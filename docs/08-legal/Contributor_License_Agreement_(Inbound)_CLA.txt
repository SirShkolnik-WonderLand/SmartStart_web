CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (INBOUND CLA)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. – Hub Ventures & Repositories
Version: 1.0 • Governing Law: Ontario, Canada

**Purpose.** This CLA sets the rights and assurances we need when **you contribute** code, docs, designs, data, or other materials (“Contributions”) to any **Venture/Project repository** hosted under the AliceSolutions GitHub organization or other Designated Systems (the “Project”). It works **on top of** the Platform Participation Agreement (PPA), Mutual NDA, Per-Project NDA Addendum (security-tiered), and (if applicable) PCA/JDA/SOW.

> This is an **inbound** license (default). If a signed SOW/MSA/JDA assigns IP to a Project/NewCo, that assignment **overrides** this license for the relevant work.

---

## 1) Parties; Effective Date; Scope

This Agreement is between **AliceSolutions Ventures Inc.** (“**AliceSolutions**”) acting for the relevant Project, and the contributor identified in Schedule A (“**Contributor**”). It takes effect on the last signature date or on the first Contribution accompanied by a DCO sign-off (the “**Effective Date**”). It covers **past and future Contributions** to Project repositories while this CLA is in force.

## 2) Definitions

* **Contribution**: Any work you submit to a Project, including source code, binaries, tests, documentation, designs, data, schemas, configs, or feedback, whether via pull request, issue attachment, email, or other mechanisms accepted by the maintainers.
* **Designated Systems**: The approved stack for confidential work (M365/Entra ID SSO + MFA, Intune + Defender, GitHub Org, approved CI/CD, secrets manager, Render.com).
* **Project**: The venture/repository listed in Schedule A and any successor fork within the same venture scope.

## 3) License Grant (Inbound)

3.1 **Copyright License.** You grant to AliceSolutions, the Project entity (including any NewCo formed for the Project), and their licensees and customers a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable** license to **use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, perform, display, and create derivative works** of your Contributions, **and to sublicense** those rights as reasonably needed to operate, improve, and commercialize the Project.

3.2 **Patent License.** You grant a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as below)** patent license to **make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer** your Contributions, where such license applies only to patent claims you control that are necessarily infringed by your Contributions alone or by combination of your Contributions with the Project.
**Defensive termination:** If any entity initiates a patent claim alleging that the Project or a Contribution infringes their patent, the patent licenses granted by that entity to the Project terminate as of filing.

3.3 **Moral Rights.** To the extent permitted by law, you **waive** and/or **consent not to assert** moral rights in your Contributions, allowing the Project to exercise the above rights.

3.4 **No Trademark Grant.** This CLA does not grant rights in trademarks, trade names, or logos.

## 4) Representations & Warranties

You represent and warrant that:
(a) **Right to Contribute.** You are the sole author and owner of your Contributions **or** you have sufficient rights from the owner to grant the licenses above.
(b) **No Hidden Restrictions.** Your Contributions are not subject to any obligation (including employer, university, grant, or third-party agreements) that would **conflict** with this CLA. If your employer or entity has rights, you must use the **Entity CLA** signature in Schedule A.
(c) **License Hygiene.** You will **identify** any third-party code/data in your Contribution and include its license files/headers; you will not include materials under licenses that **conflict** with the Project’s licensing or distribution model (e.g., copyleft where prohibited without approval).
(d) **No Malicious Code; No Secrets.** Contributions will not contain malware, backdoors, or **secrets/credentials**; you will use the Designated Secrets Manager for any required runtime secrets.
(e) **Original Source.** Contributions are submitted in **source** form (when applicable) so maintainers can review.

## 5) Public vs. Private Projects; Precedence

5.1 **Public OSS Projects.** If a Project is open source, the Project’s repository license (e.g., MIT/Apache-2.0) governs outbound distribution. This CLA ensures inbound rights so maintainers can accept your work.
5.2 **Private/Confidential Projects.** If a Project is private and under NDA, your Contributions remain confidential and handled only in **Designated Systems**; outbound licensing is internal to the Project entity.
5.3 **Assignment Overrides.** If a signed **SOW/MSA/JDA** says your work is **assigned** to the Project/NewCo (e.g., “work-made-for-hire”/assignment), **that document controls** for those Contributions; this CLA remains a backstop for all other Contributions.

## 6) Submission Process; DCO

6.1 **Sign-off.** Each commit or pull request should include a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off line, e.g.:
`Signed-off-by: Full Name <email@example.com>`
By doing so, you certify you have the rights set out in the DCO 1.1 and this CLA.

6.2 **Metadata.** You will keep Schedule A current (Git handle(s), real name, affiliation, email, repositories, contribution type).

6.3 **Contribution Logs.** The Project may maintain contribution logs mapping handles to legal identities for IP and audit purposes.

## 7) Confidentiality; Security; Compliance

7.1 **NDA Applies.** For private Projects, the Mutual NDA and **Per-Project NDA Addendum (security-tiered)** bind all contributors.
7.2 **Security Baseline.** You will use the **standard tool stack** and maintain **device compliance** (Intune + Defender) with MFA per the Access Control & BYOD Policies.
7.3 **Data Protection.** If Contributions include **personal information (PI/PHI)**, the **DPA** and any **Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)** control processing, minimization, residency, and breach handling.

## 8) Third-Party Claims; Indemnity (Narrow)

You will **defend and indemnify** the Project entity and AliceSolutions from third-party claims that your **own** Contributions (as submitted by you) infringe IP rights or violate law, **excluding** claims caused by (i) modifications not made by you, (ii) combinations not supplied by you, or (iii) maintainers’ misuse. We will: give prompt notice, allow you to control the defense, and cooperate reasonably.

## 9) Attribution; Records

The Project may credit you by Git handle or name in commit history, release notes, or contributor listings. We may store your CLA, DCO sign-offs, and contribution logs for audit, compliance, and legal defense.

## 10) Term; Termination; Survival

This CLA continues for as long as you contribute, and the licenses granted for Contributions are **irrevocable** once granted (except as provided for patent defensive termination). Either party may terminate this CLA prospectively by written notice; termination does **not** revoke rights already granted for prior Contributions. Sections **3–5, 7–12** survive as needed.

## 11) Dispute Resolution; Law; Venue

Ontario law governs; the parties submit to the **exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Toronto, Ontario**. Before litigating (other than to seek injunctions for IP/security), the parties will attempt **good-faith executive resolution**.

## 12) Entire Agreement; Amendments; Counterparts

This CLA is the entire agreement on **inbound contribution rights** to the Project, subject to precedence in §5.3. Amendments must be in a **signed writing** (including Hub click-accept where allowed). Counterparts and e-signatures (including DCO sign-offs) are valid.
