GDPR DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENT (DPIA)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Primary Law: GDPR (EU/EEA/UK variants) • Baseline: PIPEDA/PHIPA compatible

\[ ] Systematic monitoring (e.g., network, location)
\[ ] Sensitive data or highly personal data at scale
\[ ] Data processed on vulnerable subjects (e.g., children)
