Version: 1.0 • Governing Law: Ontario, Canada

This Master Services Agreement (“**MSA**”) is between **AliceSolutions Ventures Inc.** or the listing Provider named in a Statement of Work (each, “**Provider**”) and the counterparty identified below (“**Customer**”). This MSA sets baseline terms for Services performed under one or more Statements of Work (“**SOWs**”, including Change Orders). Capitalized terms have the meanings set here or in a SOW.

**Effective Date:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
**Customer (legal name):** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
**Primary contacts & notices:** see §18

## 1) Scope; SOWs; Order of Precedence

1.1 **Services.** Provider will perform the professional/managed Services (“**Services**”) and deliver the Deliverables set out in each SOW.
1.2 **SOWs.** Each SOW references this MSA and defines scope, assumptions, Deliverables, acceptance, timeline, fees, and any special terms. Change requires a signed **Change Order (CO)**.
1.3 **Order of Precedence (same subject matter):** **CO → SOW → this MSA → Data Processing Addendum (DPA) (for data terms) → Participant Collaboration Agreement (PCA)/Joint Development Agreement (JDA) (for joint builds IP) → Platform Participation Agreement (PPA) → Marketplace Terms → Hub Policies**.

---

## 2) Performance; Personnel; Subcontracting

2.1 **Standard.** Services will be performed in a professional, workmanlike manner, consistent with industry standards and Provider’s quality system.
2.2 **Personnel.** Provider may assign qualified personnel and may substitute with equal or better skill on reasonable notice.
2.3 **Subcontractors.** Provider may use subcontractors and Hub-approved Sub-processors to deliver Services, remaining **responsible** for their performance and compliance (including confidentiality, security, and DPA flow-down).

---

## 3) Customer Responsibilities

Customer will (a) provide timely access to systems, environments, and subject-matter experts; (b) make decisions/approvals within the SOW review windows; (c) supply lawful, accurate input data; and (d) ensure required third-party licenses/consents. Delays or omissions may extend timelines and adjust fees.

---

## 4) Fees; Expenses; Taxes; Invoicing

4.1 **Fees.** As specified in each SOW (fixed price, T\&M, or hybrid).
4.2 **Expenses.** Pre-approved, at cost, with receipts (travel only if requested by Customer).
4.3 **Taxes.** Fees exclude applicable taxes (GST/HST/QST and others). Customer is responsible for taxes on the Services, except taxes based on Provider’s income.
4.4 **Invoicing & Payment.** Unless stated otherwise in the SOW: (i) fixed-price milestones invoice on **acceptance**; (ii) T\&M invoices **monthly in arrears**; (iii) payment terms **Net 15**. Late amounts may accrue interest at **1.0% per month** (or the maximum permitted by law), plus reasonable collection costs. Provider may pause work for undisputed amounts over **15 days** past due after written notice.

---

## 5) Acceptance

Acceptance of each Deliverable follows the SOW: Customer has **5 business days** (or the SOW window) to accept or reject with specific reasons tied to criteria. Silence = **deemed accepted**. Provider will cure validated defects within a commercially reasonable time; re-submission restarts the review window.

---

## 6) Intellectual Property

6.1 **Background IP.** Each party retains all right, title, and interest in its pre-existing and independently developed IP and tools (“**Background IP**”). No implied licenses.
6.2 **Deliverables / Foreground IP (select in SOW):**

* **Assignment on Payment (Default).** Upon full payment and acceptance, Provider assigns to Customer (or the Project Owner/NewCo named in the SOW) all right, title, and interest in Deliverables and Foreground IP created for those Deliverables. Provider retains a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use generic know-how and non-confidential learnings.
* **License to Use.** Provider retains ownership of Deliverables and grants Customer (and its affiliates and end-users as needed) a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free** license to use, copy, modify, and create derivative works of the Deliverables for Customer’s business.
  6.3 **Embedded Background IP.** If Provider’s Background IP is embedded in a Deliverable, Provider grants Customer a **non-exclusive, royalty-free** license to use such Background IP **as embedded** in the Deliverable, limited to the Deliverable’s intended use.
  6.4 **Open Source.** Provider will comply with applicable OSS licenses, include required notices, and **not** include disallowed copyleft (e.g., AGPL) in distributed builds without Customer’s prior written consent.
  6.5 **Tools & Reusables.** Generic frameworks, templates, and automations used to deliver services remain Provider’s Background IP unless expressly assigned.

---

## 16) Force Majeure

Neither party is liable for delay or failure due to causes beyond reasonable control (e.g., acts of God, labor disputes, outages of third-party infrastructure, war, government actions), provided the affected party uses reasonable efforts to mitigate and resumes performance promptly.

---

## 17) Changes to Policies & Program Documents

Security and operational policies referenced here (e.g., Security Controls Master, Logging Standard) may be updated by Provider, provided changes do **not materially reduce** protections. Material adverse changes to privacy/security require Customer consent or an opt-out plan agreed in writing.
