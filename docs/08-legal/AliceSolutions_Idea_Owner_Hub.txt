IDEA OWNER PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT
(Inside the AliceSolutions Hub)
Version: 1.0 • Governing Law: Ontario, Canada

**Read first.** This agreement governs how an **Idea Owner** may disclose an idea for **evaluation inside the Hub**. It does **not** by itself create a partnership, joint venture, or obligation to build, fund, or commercialize anything. If an idea is selected, the parties will execute the appropriate **PCA/JDA**, **Equity/Vesting**, **SOW/MSA**, **Per-Project NDA Addendum (security-tiered)**, and, where applicable, a **DPA**.

---

## 1) Parties; Effective Date

This Agreement is between **AliceSolutions Ventures Inc.** (“**AliceSolutions**”) and the submitting party identified at signature (“**Idea Owner**”). It takes effect on the date of last signature (the “**Effective Date**”).

## 2) Definitions

* **Idea**: The concept, problem statement, requirements, sketches, notes, demos, and all related materials disclosed by Idea Owner for evaluation (collectively, “**Idea Materials**”).
* **Evaluation**: Review, scoping, diligence, feasibility analysis, and limited prototyping (if any) to determine whether to pursue the Idea.
* **Project Agreements**: Any later contracts that govern build/commercialization (e.g., **Participant Collaboration Agreement (PCA)**, **Joint Development Agreement (JDA)**, **Statement of Work (SOW)** under an **MSA**, equity documents).
* **Designated Systems**: AliceSolutions’ approved stack for confidential work (M365/Entra ID SSO + MFA, Intune + Defender, GitHub Org, approved CI/CD, secrets manager, Render.com, backups, DLP).

## 3) Order of Precedence

On the **same subject matter**, the following order controls: **Per-Project NDA Addendum (if issued)** → **this Agreement** → **Mutual NDA (Internal)** → **DPA** (for data terms only) → **Platform Participation Agreement (PPA)** → Hub policies.

## 4) Submissions; Representations

4.1 **Authority & Rights.** Idea Owner represents and warrants that it (a) owns, controls, or is duly licensed to disclose the Idea Materials; (b) disclosure does not breach any obligation to a third party (including employer, university, accelerator, or grant body); and (c) the materials do not knowingly infringe another’s IP.
4.2 **No Harmful Content.** Idea Materials will be free of malware and will not include regulated/sensitive data unless pre-approved in writing and covered by the **DPA/PHIPA schedule** where applicable.
4.3 **No Substitution for Filing.** Idea Owner remains responsible for any patent filings or other IP protection. Disclosure here is **not** a patent filing and may affect patentability if shared publicly by Idea Owner.

## 5) Confidentiality & Security

5.1 **NDA Applies.** The parties’ **Mutual NDA (Internal)** governs confidentiality for Idea Materials; if a **Per-Project NDA Addendum (security-tiered)** is issued, it applies to any hands-on review.
5.2 **Designated Systems.** AliceSolutions will handle Idea Materials only in **Designated Systems** and will ensure reviewers are subject to confidentiality obligations.
5.3 **Non-Exfiltration.** Neither party will export or store Idea Materials outside Designated Systems without written approval, and then only with equal or stronger protections.

## 6) Evaluation License (Limited)

6.1 **Grant.** Idea Owner grants AliceSolutions a **non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable (except to affiliates/contractors under NDA), revocable license** to **use, copy, display, and test** the Idea Materials **solely to evaluate** whether and how the Idea could be pursued in the Hub.
6.2 **No Build Rights.** This license **does not** allow commercialization, public launch, or delivery to customers; such rights arise only under executed **Project Agreements**.
6.3 **Contractors/Affiliates.** AliceSolutions may involve vetted contractors/affiliates for evaluation if they are bound by written confidentiality and security obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.

## 7) Independent Development; No Exclusivity

7.1 **Independent Development Safe Harbor.** AliceSolutions may already be, or later become, involved in concepts similar to the Idea. AliceSolutions will not use Idea Owner’s **Confidential Information** to develop a competing offering; however, **independent development** without use of such Confidential Information does not breach this Agreement.
7.2 **No Exclusivity.** This Agreement does not grant exclusivity. Any exclusivity or right of first refusal must be expressly set out in later **Project Agreements**.

## 8) No Obligation to Proceed; No Implied Compensation

8.1 **Sole Discretion.** AliceSolutions has no obligation to pursue the Idea. Either party may end Evaluation at any time on written notice.
8.2 **No Implied Payments.** Unless a **SOW** or other written agreement is executed, (a) AliceSolutions owes no fees for reviewing the Idea; and (b) Idea Owner owes no fees for submitting it.

## 9) Selection & Next Steps

If the Idea is selected for build/commercialization, the parties will promptly execute the relevant **Project Agreements** (e.g., **PCA/JDA**, **SOW/MSA**, equity/vesting). Until then, **no partnership, joint venture, IP assignment, revenue share, or employment** is created or implied.

## 10) Intellectual Property

10.1 **Background IP.** Each party retains all right, title, and interest in its **Background IP**.
10.2 **Foreground IP.** Any IP created **during Evaluation** belongs to the creating party unless otherwise agreed in a signed **SOW/JDA**. Foreground IP generated **during build** will be governed by the executed **Project Agreements**.
10.3 **Feedback.** Non-confidential feedback given by Idea Owner may be used to improve the Hub without obligation. Feedback expressly marked confidential is treated under the NDA.

## 11) Data Protection & Privacy

11.1 **DPA.** To the extent Idea Materials include **Personal Information**, the parties will execute and comply with the **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)** (PIPEDA/PHIPA baseline; GDPR/UK add-ons where needed).
11.2 **Minimization.** Idea Owner agrees to **minimize** Personal Information in submissions and to avoid including any special category data unless pre-approved in writing.
11.3 **Residency.** Default data residency is **Canada**; additional regions require Legal approval and entry in the sub-processor register.

## 12) Non-Solicitation

During Evaluation and for **12 months** thereafter, neither party will directly solicit the other’s employees or dedicated contractors **for work that would bypass the Hub process**. This does not prohibit general solicitations not targeted at the other party’s personnel.

## 13) Term; Termination; Return/Deletion

13.1 **Term.** This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues until (a) the parties sign Project Agreements; or (b) either party terminates Evaluation under §8.1.
13.2 **Return/Deletion.** On termination, each party will promptly **return or delete** the other’s Confidential Information, except for (i) routine backups (held securely and purged per retention policy) and (ii) records needed to comply with law or enforce rights.
13.3 **Exit Attestation.** Upon request, Idea Owner will sign a short **Exit Attestation** confirming return/deletion and cessation of use.

## 14) Publicity

No party may issue public statements about the Idea or the relationship without the other’s prior written consent, except as required by law (after giving reasonable notice to seek protective measures).

## 15) Warranties; Disclaimers; Liability

15.1 **Mutual Authority Warranty.** Each party warrants it has authority to enter and perform this Agreement.
15.2 **Disclaimer.** **Except as expressly stated, all Idea Materials and Evaluation activities are provided “AS IS.”**
15.3 **Limitation of Liability.** To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither party is liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Each party’s total direct liability under this Agreement is capped at **CAD \$5,000**, **except** for breaches of confidentiality, data protection violations, or willful misconduct.

## 16) Indemnity (Third-Party IP Claims)

Idea Owner will indemnify AliceSolutions against third-party claims that Idea Materials, as submitted, infringe IP rights—**excluding** claims arising from AliceSolutions’ modifications or combinations not supplied by Idea Owner. AliceSolutions will (a) notify promptly; (b) allow Idea Owner to control the defense; and (c) cooperate reasonably.

## 17) Notices; E-Sign; Counterparts

17.1 **Notices** may be delivered via the Hub and/or email addresses on the signature page.
17.2 **E-Sign.** Electronic signatures and records are valid.
17.3 **Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, including PDF/e-signature copies.

## 18) Assignment

Neither party may assign this Agreement without the other’s consent, **except** to a successor (by merger, acquisition, or asset sale) that assumes all obligations. Any prohibited assignment is void.

## 19) Governing Law; Disputes

This Agreement is governed by the laws of **Ontario, Canada**. The parties submit to the **exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Toronto, Ontario**. Before filing suit (other than for injunctive relief), the parties will attempt **good-faith resolution** through executive escalation.

## 20) Survival; Entire Agreement; Amendments

Sections **5 (Confidentiality & Security), 6 (Evaluation License) to the extent needed to wind-down, 7 (Independent Development), 10 (Intellectual Property), 11 (Data Protection), 12 (Non-Solicitation), 13.2–13.3 (Return/Deletion), 15 (Warranties/Disclaimers/Liability), 16 (Indemnity), 17–19 (Notices/Law)** survive termination. This is the **entire agreement** for evaluation of the Idea and may be amended only in a **signed writing** (including Hub click-accept, where permitted).
