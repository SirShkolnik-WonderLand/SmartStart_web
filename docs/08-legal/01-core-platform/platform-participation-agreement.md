## Parties

**AliceSolutions Ventures Inc.** ("AliceSolutions", "we", "us")

## 1. Purpose & Scope

The SmartStart Platform provides a secure ecosystem for:
- Discovering and evaluating venture opportunities
- Subscribing to platform services and tools
- Proposing contributions and collaborations
- Managing projects under project-specific NDAs and addenda
- Tracking rewards, equity, and compensation

This Platform Participation Agreement (PPA) governs:
- Platform membership and access
- Payment terms and billing
- Acceptable use and community standards
- Contribution and intellectual property rights
- Security requirements and compliance
- Liability limitations and dispute resolution

**Legal Pack Integration:** This PPA works together with the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement and any Per-Project NDA Addenda you sign (collectively, the "Legal Pack"). In case of conflict, Per-Project Addenda control for specific projects, Mutual NDA controls confidentiality, and this PPA controls platform membership, payments, and general terms.
