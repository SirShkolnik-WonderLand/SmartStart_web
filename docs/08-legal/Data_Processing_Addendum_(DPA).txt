DATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM (DPA)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Governing Law (baseline): Ontario, Canada

**Purpose.** This DPA sets privacy, security, and cross-border transfer terms when **AliceSolutions Ventures Inc.** (“**AliceSolutions**”) processes **Personal Information** on behalf of the counterparty identified in Schedule A (“**Customer**”) in connection with the Hub and any Venture/Project services (the “**Services**”). This DPA is incorporated into and forms part of the applicable commercial agreement(s) between the parties (the “**Agreement**”).

> **Canadian baseline (PIPEDA/PHIPA).** Modules for EU/UK GDPR transfers (SCCs/UK Addendum) are attached and apply if EU/UK Personal Data is in scope. Project-to-project participant sharing is covered by a separate **Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)** when both parties act as Controllers.

“**Personal Information**” (PI) means information about an identifiable individual (or “personal data” under GDPR/UK GDPR).
“**PHI**” means personal health information under Ontario **PHIPA**.
“**Controller**” (“Organization” under PIPEDA) determines purposes and means of Processing.
“**Processor**” (“Service Provider” under PIPEDA) Processes on behalf of Controller.
“**Sub-processor**” means a Processor engaged by AliceSolutions.
“**Processing**” means any operation performed on PI (collection, storage, use, disclosure, deletion, etc.).

6.2 **EU/EEA/Swiss/UK Personal Data.** Where PI is transferred to a country without an adequacy decision, the parties **incorporate by reference** the **EU Standard Contractual Clauses (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914)**:

* **Module 2 (Controller→Processor)** and/or **Module 3 (Processor→Processor)**, as applicable to each transfer;
* With Annexes populated by **Schedule A (Processing Details)** and **Schedule B (Security Measures)**;
* **Data Exporter:** Customer; **Data Importer:** AliceSolutions (and its Sub-processors when applicable).

10.2 Deletion will follow secure erasure procedures; upon request, AliceSolutions will provide a **Deletion Certificate/Attestation**.

## 11) PHIPA (Ontario) — If PHI In Scope

11.1 Where Customer is a **Health Information Custodian**, AliceSolutions acts as an **agent** under PHIPA and will: (a) collect, use, disclose PHI only as permitted by the custodian; (b) safeguard PHI against unauthorized handling; (c) notify the custodian **at the first reasonable opportunity** of a privacy breach; (d) make PHI available to the custodian for access/correction; (e) ensure Sub-processors with PHI comply with PHIPA.
11.2 A **PHIPA Schedule** may be attached for additional specifics (logging, masking, retention, role-based access, breach escalation).

## 12) Customer Data Responsibilities

Customer will not instruct AliceSolutions to Process prohibited/sensitive data unless pre-approved in writing (e.g., payment card data beyond PSP tokenization; government-issued identifiers where not necessary; special category data under GDPR). Customer warrants its instructions comply with laws and do not require AliceSolutions to violate provider terms or export controls.

## 13) Liability; Indemnity

13.1 **Allocation.** Each party’s DPA liability is limited as stated in the Agreement, **except** that nothing limits liability for **willful misconduct, fraud, or breach of confidentiality/security** to the extent prohibited by law.
13.2 **Regulatory Fines.** To the extent permitted by law, each party bears fines that are finally imposed **due to that party’s own non-compliance** with data protection law in its capacity (Controller or Processor).

## 14) Conflicts; Order of Precedence

If there is conflict between this DPA and the Agreement, this DPA **controls** on privacy/security/transfer matters. If there is conflict between this DPA and the SCCs/UK Addendum for a covered transfer, the **SCCs/UK Addendum prevail**.

## 15) Term; Termination

This DPA lasts for the term of the Agreement and any wind-down period necessary for export/deletion. Sections **4–11, 13–16** survive termination as needed.

## 16) Governing Law; Venue
