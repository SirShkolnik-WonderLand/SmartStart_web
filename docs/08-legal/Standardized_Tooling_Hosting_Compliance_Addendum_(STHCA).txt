STANDARDIZED TOOLING & HOSTING COMPLIANCE ADDENDUM (STHCA)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Governing Law (baseline): Ontario, Canada

**Purpose.** This Addendum defines the **standard tool stack**, **tiered security controls**, and **hosting/compliance rules** that apply whenever Members access **non-public Hub/venture resources**. It is incorporated by reference into the **Platform Participation Agreement (PPA)**, **PTSA/PUOHA**, **Security Tooling Acknowledgment (STA)**, **MSA/SOW**, and—where applicable—the **DPA/DSA**, **PCA/JDA**.

**Order of precedence (same subject matter):** **Change Order → SOW/MSA → PUOHA → this STHCA → PTSA → DPA/DSA (for data terms) → PCA/JDA (for IP in joint builds) → PPA → Hub Policies.**

---

## 1) Scope & Applicability

1.1 This STHCA applies to all **Projects/Ventures** using the Hub’s non-public infrastructure, repositories, data, or environments.
1.2 It binds all Participants, Providers, contractors, and Idea Owners once they (a) hold an active **PTSA** seat and (b) accept the **STA**.

---

## 2) Key Definitions

* **Designated Systems** — The approved stack: **Microsoft 365** (Entra ID SSO+MFA; Exchange/Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive), **Intune & Defender** (endpoint), **GitHub Organization (SSO)**, approved **CI/CD runners**, **Designated Secrets Manager**, **Render.com** hosting, approved **observability** and **backup** providers.
* **Data Tiers** — **T1 (Internal)**, **T2 (Confidential)**, **T3 (Restricted/Crown-Jewel)**. The **highest tier touched** by any data governs handling for the **entire workflow**.
* **Compliant Device** — Intune-enrolled, Defender EDR healthy, disk-encrypted, patched device meeting baseline policies.
* **Production Data** — Any data from live users/systems, or data deemed sensitive by Owner; includes tokens/keys.
* **Sub-processor** — Third party engaged to process data on behalf of AliceSolutions or a Project.

---

## 3) Standardized Tool Stack (must use)

Participants must use **only** the following for Hub work; **shadow IT** is prohibited.

1. **Identity & Email:** M365 under Hub domain; **Entra ID SSO + MFA**; Conditional Access.
2. **Endpoint:** **Intune** compliance; **Defender EDR**; full-disk encryption; screen lock; auto-patch.
3. **Source & CI/CD:** **GitHub Org (SSO)**; protected branches; required reviews; secret scanning; approved runners; signed commits/artifacts where required.
4. **Secrets:** **Designated Secrets Manager**; **no secrets** in code, tickets, chat, or logs.
5. **Hosting:** **Render.com** services provisioned via the Hub; config via env/secret injection—**no hard-coded secrets**.
6. **Storage & Collaboration:** **SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams** in Hub tenant; **no personal drives/emails**.
7. **Observability:** Approved logs/metrics/traces provider connected through Hub; tamper-evident retention per tier.
8. **Backups/DR:** Hub-managed M365/repo/DB backups; quarterly restore tests.

> **Note:** These are **minimums**. Projects may adopt stricter controls.

## 5) Provisioning & Lifecycle (Joiner/Mover/Leaver)

5.1 **Joiner:** Identity verification → accept **PPA/STA/ESign/DPA (if needed)** → M365 account → MFA → Intune enrollment/Defender healthy → GitHub SSO and team mapping → Secrets namespaces created → environment access granted.
5.2 **Mover:** Update groups/roles same day; remove no-longer-needed access; rotate exposed secrets.
5.3 **Leaver:** Disable accounts within **4 hours** (immediate for cause); revoke tokens; remove from groups; rotate secrets; collect **Exit Attestation**; schedule data export (if permitted) and deletion per retention schedule.

---

## 6) Data Classification & Handling

6.1 **Classify** data at intake; select tier (**T1/T2/T3**) and residency in the project record.
6.2 **Label** documents and repos accordingly (metadata/tags).
6.3 **Minimize PI/PHI**; avoid special categories unless pre-approved; if PI/PHI is present, the **DPA/PHIPA schedule** applies.
6.4 **Production data** in lower environments requires masking/synthetic data unless exception approved.
6.5 **No exfiltration** to personal accounts or unapproved tools; DLP monitors are active.

---

## 7) Sub-processors & External Services

7.1 Only Sub-processors on the **Register** may be used; updates follow the notice process.
7.2 New vendors require security/privacy due diligence, residency review, and contract clauses (confidentiality, breach notice, SSCs/UK addendum if needed).
7.3 GitHub/Render/Microsoft services are baseline; additional cloud resources must be provisioned through the Hub with spend caps.

---

## 8) CI/CD, Releases & Secrets

8.1 **CI gates:** lint, unit/integration tests (coverage target per SOW), SAST/dep scan clean, SBOM attached, artifact signing (T3).
8.2 **Releases:** environment approvals; change tickets; canary/rollback plan; observability hooks.
8.3 **Secrets:** stored only in **Secrets Manager**; rotate per tier or on signal; prohibit plaintext in code/tickets/chat/logs.
8.4 **Keys:** KMS/HSM where supported; key custodianship documented; compromise playbook maintained.

---

## 9) Evidence, Reviews & Audits

9.1 **Evidence pack** (per project): access reviews, exception log, SBOMs, pipeline policies, restore test records, vulnerability backlog with SLAs, incident drill outcomes.
9.2 **Internal reviews:** quarterly for T2; monthly for T3 (lightweight check-ins allowed).
9.3 **Audits:** Customer or AliceSolutions may perform reasonable audits per **DPA/MSA** terms; multi-tenant safety respected.
9.4 **Pen tests:** at least annually for externally exposed T2/T3 services (or after material changes); summaries shared on request.

---

## 10) Exceptions & Waivers

10.1 **Process:** Submit an **Exception Request** stating need, scope, tier, duration (≤ **30 days**), and compensating controls.
10.2 **Approval:** CISO (or delegate) + Project Owner; logged in **Exception Register**; auto-reminders at 7/3/1 days before expiry.
10.3 **Revocation:** Exceptions can be revoked for new risk signals or incident.

---

## 11) Non-Compliance & Enforcement

11.1 **Gating:** Non-compliance with STA/STHCA or unpaid PTSA may **block access** to non-public resources.
11.2 **Remediation:** Findings are tracked with owners/dates; repeated or willful breaches may result in suspension, removal from projects, and contract remedies.
11.3 **Cost recovery:** Where permitted by contract, costs to investigate/remediate willful breaches may be **charged back**.

---

## 12) Amendments & Updates

AliceSolutions may update this STHCA to reflect security or operational improvements. Material reductions in protection require notice and, where applicable, Customer consent. Latest version is posted in the Hub.

---

## 13) Term; Survival

This STHCA remains in effect while the Member uses non-public resources. Sections **4–11** survive offboarding as needed (e.g., evidence, audit, liability, confidentiality through related agreements).
