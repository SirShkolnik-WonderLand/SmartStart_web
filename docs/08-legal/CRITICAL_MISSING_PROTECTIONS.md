- Irrevocably and permanently

```

## 2. WORLDWIDE JURISDICTION CLAUSE (CRITICAL)

### **Current Problem:**
Only Ontario jurisdiction - can't enforce worldwide against IP thieves.

The parties agree that this Agreement may be enforced in any jurisdiction worldwide where:
- The Contributor resides or conducts business
