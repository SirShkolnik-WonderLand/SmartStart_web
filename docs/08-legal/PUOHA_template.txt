PLATFORM USAGE ORDER & HOSTING ADDENDUM (PUOHA)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Governing Law: Ontario, Canada

## 2) WHAT THE BASE PTSA SEAT INCLUDES (per user, per month)

Each **Base Seat** provides the **standardized, secured tool stack** required to access non-public projects (see PTSA/STHCA for full rules):

1. **Microsoft 365** tenant account under Hub domain (Exchange/Teams/OneDrive/SharePoint), **Entra ID SSO + MFA**, and **Defender for Office**.
2. **Endpoint compliance** via **Intune** and **Defender for Endpoint** (Win/Mac/mobile) with policy baselines.
3. **GitHub Organization** membership (SSO enforced) with project-scoped repo access.
4. Access to Hub apps, CI/CD runners (shared), **Secrets Manager** standard quotas, and **Render.com** base hosting allocations attached to the project.
5. **Backups** (M365 + repos + DBs) per the **Data Retention Schedule** baseline; restore on request.
6. **Security monitoring & DLP** per tier (email/share controls; secret scanning).
7. **Identity and access governance** (RBAC groups, PIM JIT elevation, quarterly access reviews).

> **Seat rule:** Any person who **views or touches** non-public venture data or repos must have an **active Base Seat** and be **device-compliant**. Shared accounts are prohibited.

---

## 3) HOSTING & RESOURCES (Render.com & related)

3.1 **Environments.** Each covered project includes **dev** and **staging** allocations in the base; **production** is enabled when the Project Owner authorizes go-live.
3.2 **Default plan.** Base includes Render.com **Starter/Standard** equivalents sufficient for small services;
**Pro/Plus** tiers, dedicated instances, static IPs, private networking, or increased storage/egress are **Add-Ons** (Schedule C).
3.3 **Secrets & config.** All secrets are injected from the **Designated Secrets Manager**; no secrets in repos or logs.
3.4 **Spending caps.** Customer may set monthly caps per project; exceeding caps pauses non-critical workloads unless Customer approves overage.

---

## 4) PRICING, BILLING & TAXES

4.1 **Base Seats.** Billed **monthly in advance** at CAD **\$100** per active seat (baseline), plus taxes. Seats added mid-cycle are **prorated** to month-end; removals take effect next cycle.
4.2 **Add-Ons & Usage.** Add-Ons (Schedule C) and variable usage (e.g., extra build minutes, storage, egress) are **billed in arrears**.
4.3 **Pass-through changes.** Vendor price increases (e.g., M365, GitHub, Render) are **passed through**; AliceSolutions will notify **30 days** in advance where practicable.
4.4 **Price updates.** AliceSolutions may adjust **Base Seat** pricing with **30 days’** notice (future cycles only).
4.5 **Taxes & fees.** GST/HST/QST and card/payment processing fees (if applicable) are added.
4.6 **Payment terms.** Net **15** days from invoice. Late amounts may accrue **1% per month** (or legal max). Non-payment may trigger **suspension** per §11.

---

## 5) PROVISIONING & JOINER/MOVER/LEAVER

5.1 **Provisioning timeline.** Within **2 business days** of order (or per SOW), AliceSolutions provisions seats, creates accounts, and enrolls devices.
5.2 **Joiners.** Require: identity verification, **ESignature Consent**, **PPA**, **Mutual NDA**, **PTSA**, **STHCA**, DPA/DSA if applicable; device **Intune + Defender** compliance before access.
5.3 **Movers.** Role changes via ticket; prior access **removed same day**; secrets rotated as needed.
5.4 **Leavers.** Seat is disabled within **4 hours** of notice (immediate for cause). Data is retained per the **Data Retention Schedule**; offboarding **Exit Attestation** required.

---

## 6) USAGE REQUIREMENTS & SECURITY (summary)

6.1 **Designated Systems only.** Email, files, code, CI/CD, secrets, hosting must remain within **approved tenants/orgs**; no external forwarding or shadow tools.
6.2 **Device posture.** Access to T2/T3 data requires **compliant** devices (Intune + Defender healthy).
6.3 **DLP & exports.** Printing/exporting T2 requires approval; T3 exports are **prohibited** unless expressly authorized with compensating controls.
6.4 **Monitoring.** Identity, repo, CI, and runtime events are logged; alerts handled per **IRP**.
6.5 **Exceptions.** Time-boxed (≤ 30 days) with CISO approval and compensating controls; tracked in the **Exception Log**.

---

## 7) DATA PROTECTION & RESIDENCY

7.1 **DPA/DSA.** Where **PI/PHI** is processed, the **DPA** (Processor terms) applies; controller-to-controller exchanges require a **DSA**.
7.2 **Residency.** Default hosting is **Canada**; additional regions require entry in Schedule A and sub-processor review.
7.3 **Sub-processors.** Use of Microsoft 365, GitHub, Render.com, and approved observability providers per the **Sub-processor Register**.

---

## 8) SERVICE MANAGEMENT & SUPPORT

8.1 **Channels.** Hub ticketing (P1–P4), with **Standard** or **Enhanced** SLOs (Schedule A/SOW).
8.2 **Maintenance windows.** Published in the Hub; emergency changes allowed for security fixes.
8.3 **Third-party SLAs.** Vendor SLAs (Microsoft/GitHub/Render/etc.) apply to their services; AliceSolutions coordinates but isn’t liable for vendor outages beyond credits received and passed through.

---

## 9) FAIR USE & CAPACITY

9.1 **Shared platform.** Build minutes, runners, logs, and bandwidth are pooled with fair-use thresholds; chronic overage → require Add-On upgrade.
9.2 **Abuse & risk.** Crypto-mining, scanning, or prohibited content triggers immediate suspension pending review.

---

## 10) PRICE CHANGES & SCALING

10.1 **Growth adjustments.** As the Hub scales, Base Seat price **may increase**; AliceSolutions will provide **30 days’** notice.
10.2 **Auto-scale add-ons.** If monitored usage repeatedly exceeds 120% of allocated capacity, Customer authorizes auto-upgrade to the next tier, with notice.

---

## 11) SUSPENSION, TERMINATION & CANCELLATION

11.1 **Suspension.** AliceSolutions may suspend access for non-payment (after notice), security risk, legal requirement, or material breach of PTSA/STHCA.
11.2 **Cancellation.** Customer may cancel seats or Add-Ons **effective next cycle** via the Hub; pro-rated refunds are **not** provided for current cycle unless legally required.
11.3 **Termination.** This PUOHA ends when the underlying MSA/SOW or account is terminated. Surviving obligations: fees due, confidentiality, data protection, and offboarding commitments.

---

## 12) LIABILITY & MISCELLANEOUS

12.1 **Limits.** Liability is as set in the **MSA**. For avoidance of doubt, pass-through vendor costs and unpaid usage remain payable.
12.2 **Notices.** Via Hub and/or email to the contacts above.
12.3 **E-Sign.** Parties consent to electronic signatures/records per **ESignature Consent**.
12.4 **Amendments.** Changes to this order require a signed **Change Order (CO)** (Schedule F) or Hub click-accept update for purely commercial line changes (seat counts, add-ons).
