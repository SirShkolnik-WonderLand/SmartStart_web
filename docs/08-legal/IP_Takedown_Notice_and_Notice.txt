IP TAKEDOWN (NOTICE-AND-NOTICE) POLICY & FORMS
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Jurisdiction: Ontario, Canada

> **Purpose.** This Policy describes how AliceSolutions handles copyright **notices of claimed infringement** under Canada’s **Notice-and-Notice** regime (Copyright Act ss. 41.25–41.27). We forward compliant notices “**as soon as feasible**,” retain subscriber-identifying records for **6 months** (or **1 year** if the claimant starts proceedings and notifies us), and communicate with the involved user(s). We may remove/disable access in clear cases or for repeat/serious violations under our Terms. ([Justice Laws][1])

> **Not legal advice.** This document is operational guidance for the Hub. It is not legal advice.

---

# A) POLICY SUMMARY

1. **We forward compliant notices.** When we receive a notice that **meets the statutory content requirements** and **excludes prohibited content**, we forward it to the user responsible for the identified location and inform the complainant that we did so. “As soon as feasible.” ([Justice Laws][2])
2. **We retain records.** We keep records enabling identification of the user **for 6 months from receipt** of the notice, or **1 year** if the complainant commences proceedings and notifies us before the 6-month period ends. ([Justice Laws][1])
3. **We may act on content.** Although Canadian law doesn’t mandate DMCA-style takedown, we **may** remove/disable access to clearly infringing or high-risk materials (e.g., public repo binaries/assets) and for **repeat infringers** under our Terms and Acceptable Use Policy. See Section C.
4. **We reject non-compliant notices.** If a notice **includes settlement demands, payment requests, personal-info demands, or links to any of these**, we treat it as **non-compliant** and will not forward it; we’ll reply with a deficiency explanation. ([Justice Laws][2])
5. **Fees.** We **do not charge** to forward notices unless a regulation sets a maximum fee. If **no maximum is fixed by regulation, no fee may be charged**. ([Justice Laws][1])
6. **Privacy.** We **do not disclose** subscriber identity to complainants **without a valid court order or legal requirement**.
7. **Records & audit.** We maintain a **Takedown Log** (notice, counter-notice, actions, timestamps, decision) for audit/compliance.

# B) HOW TO SEND A NOTICE (COMPLAINANTS)

**Send to:** `ip@alicesolutions.example` (preferred) or via the Hub IP portal.

Your **Notice of Claimed Infringement** **must** be **in writing** and include **all** of the following statutory items (Copyright Act s. 41.25(2)), and **must not** include prohibited content (s. 41.25(3)):

**Required content (ALL):**

1. Your **name and address** (and any other contact particulars).
2. Identification of the **copyrighted work/subject-matter**.
3. A statement of your **interest/right** in the work.
4. **Location data** for the **electronic location** (e.g., precise URL, repository path, file hash).
5. The **infringement alleged** (what act and how).
6. The **date and time** of the alleged infringement. ([Justice Laws][2])

**Prohibited content (ANY = non-compliant):**
• **Settlement offers**, **requests/demands for payment**, **demands for personal information**, or **links** to any of the foregoing. ([Justice Laws][2])

We **acknowledge** receipt and will forward compliant notices to the identified user “as soon as feasible” and inform you of forwarding. ([Justice Laws][1])

---

# C) WHAT WE DO UPON RECEIPT

1. **Initial check.** Verify the notice satisfies s. 41.25(2) and contains none of s. 41.25(3) **prohibited** content. Non-compliant notices are rejected with a deficiency reply and instructions to resubmit. ([Justice Laws][2])
2. **Forwarding.** For compliant notices, we **forward electronically** to the user responsible for the location **as soon as feasible**, and inform the complainant of forwarding or reasons it was not possible. ([Justice Laws][1])
3. **Record retention.** We retain subscriber-identifying records for **6 months**, or **1 year** if the complainant starts proceedings and notifies us before the 6 months end. ([Justice Laws][1])
4. **Evaluate content action (platform governance).**

   * **Clear cases** (e.g., unlicensed distribution of third-party binaries, obvious piracy in public artifacts): we **may** disable access/remove while the dispute is addressed.
   * **Ambiguous disputes** (e.g., fair-dealing, license interpretation): we generally **do not remove** unless there is a court order, legal risk, or Terms/Policy breach beyond copyright.
   * **Repeat/serious violations:** we may **suspend access** and notify project owners; repeated confirmed infringements can lead to account termination under our Terms.
5. **Statutory damages against intermediaries.** A claimant’s sole remedy for our failure to perform forwarding/retention obligations is **statutory damages** between **\$5,000–\$10,000** (subject to regulation). ([Justice Laws][1])
