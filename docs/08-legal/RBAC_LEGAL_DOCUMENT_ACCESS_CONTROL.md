    signed_at TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    document_version VARCHAR(50),
    signature_hash VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Document access control
CREATE TABLE document_access_control (
    document_id VARCHAR(255),
    rbac_level VARCHAR(100),
    is_required BOOLEAN,
    prerequisite_documents JSON
);
```

### 2. **API Endpoints**
