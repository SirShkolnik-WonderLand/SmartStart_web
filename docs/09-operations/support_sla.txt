SUPPORT & INCIDENT RESPONSE SLA
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Timezone: America/Toronto (ET) • Governing Law: Ontario, Canada

**Scope.** This SLA applies to (a) the Hub control plane and core platform services operated by AliceSolutions, and (b) standard support for Projects/Ventures hosted on Designated Systems (M365/Entra, Intune/Defender, GitHub Org, CI/CD, Secrets Manager, Render.com, approved observability/backups). Vendor SLAs flow through as credits where available.

**Order of precedence (same subject matter):** Change Order → SOW/MSA → PUOHA/PTSA → this SLA → STHCA/STA → Marketplace Terms → Hub Policies.

---

## 1) Support Plans & Hours

* **Standard Support (default):** Business hours **Mon–Fri 09:00–18:00 ET**, excluding Ontario statutory holidays. P1 handled outside hours on best-effort.
* **Enhanced Support (add-on):** **24×7** for **P1**; extended coverage for P2 (07:00–22:00 ET). Add-on appears in PUOHA/PTSA.

**Channels:** Hub ticketing (preferred), email support@… (auto-creates ticket), P1 hotline/bridge (posted in Hub).

---

## 2) Priority Definitions

* **P1 – Critical:** Complete outage or security incident affecting production for multiple users/tenants; data-loss in progress; CI/CD blocked for prod hotfix; RPO/RTO at risk.
* **P2 – Major:** Material degradation or feature failure with significant user impact; no reasonable workaround.
* **P3 – Minor/Bug:** Limited impact; workaround available; performance or cosmetic issues.
* **P4 – Request/How-to/Change:** Questions, access requests, non-urgent changes.

## 3) Targets (Response, Workaround, Restore/Resolution)

| Plan     | Priority | Initial Response          | Workaround Target | Restore/Resolution Target           |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Standard | P1       | **≤ 1h** (BH)             | ≤ 4h              | ≤ 8h (best effort if vendor outage) |
| Standard | P2       | ≤ 4h (BH)                 | ≤ 1 business day  | ≤ 2 business days                   |
| Standard | P3       | ≤ 1 business day          | In next sprint    | ≤ 1–3 sprints (severity-based)      |
| Standard | P4       | ≤ 2 business days         | n/a               | Scheduled by change window          |
| Enhanced | P1       | **≤ 30 min (24×7)**       | ≤ 2h              | ≤ 4h (or emergency workaround)      |
| Enhanced | P2       | **≤ 1h** (07:00–22:00 ET) | ≤ 8h              | ≤ 1 business day                    |

*Restore = service availability/function back to acceptable level; permanent fix may follow.*

## 4) Uptime Objective (Hub control plane)

**99.9% monthly** target for the Hub control plane (auth, core API, ticketing). Excludes scheduled maintenance and third-party outages (see §7). Status updates via the in-Hub banner/status page.

---

## 5) Incident Management & Escalation

1. **Intake** → ticket created; priority set; comms channel opened.
2. **Stabilize** → workaround/rollback/canary.
3. **Resolve** → service restored; confirm via monitoring.
4. **Post-incident** → PIR within **3 business days** for P1 (root cause, timeline, actions).
   **Escalation ladder:** Support Engineer → Duty Manager → Head of Engineering → CISO (security) → Exec sponsor.

---

## 6) Maintenance Windows

* **Scheduled:** Posted ≥ **72 hours** in advance; typical **Sat 22:00–Sun 02:00 ET**.
* **Emergency:** Security/critical hotfixes may proceed with short notice; we minimize impact.

---

## 7) Exclusions

* Customer-caused changes/misconfiguration; work on non-compliant devices (see STA/STHCA).
* Third-party vendor outages (Microsoft, GitHub, Render.com, PSP, ISP); we pass through any credits.
* Force majeure; DDoS beyond provider mitigation; exceeding contracted capacity/spend caps.
* Issues in unsupported stacks/tools outside Designated Systems.

---

## 8) Service Credits (platform services only)

If monthly uptime for the **Hub control plane** falls below target **or** P1 response targets are missed under **Enhanced Support**, you may request a credit within **30 days** of month-end.

**Uptime-based credits (per affected month):**

* 99.0%–99.89% → **5%** of platform MRC
* 98.0%–98.99% → **10%**
* < 98.0% → **25%**

**P1 response breach (Enhanced):** **5%** per verified breach, capped at **25%** combined with uptime credits.

Credits apply to **future invoices**, non-transferable, no cash refunds. Marketplace purchases are excluded (governed by Listings/MSA).

---

## 9) Customer Responsibilities

* Designate P1 contacts; keep runbooks/access current.
* Provide logs/telemetry and reasonable remote access when requested.
* Follow STA/STHCA; use Secrets Manager; avoid shadow IT.
* Submit change requests (P4) with impact window; respect freeze periods.

---

## 10) Security Incidents

Handled under the **IRP** and **DPA** (breach notice ≤ **24h** from confirmation). P1 bridge is used; forensics artifacts preserved; deletion/return per DPA on close.

---

## 11) Changes

We may update this SLA to improve clarity or reflect service changes. Material reductions require **30 days’ notice**.
