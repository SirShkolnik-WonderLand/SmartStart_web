BILLING & TRANSACTIONS POLICY
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Currency: CAD • Governing Law: Ontario, Canada

**Scope.** This Policy governs subscriptions (PTSA/PUOHA seats), platform add-ons/usage, and Hub marketplace transactions. Provider payouts remain governed by **Marketplace Terms**.

**Order of precedence (same subject matter):** Change Order → PUOHA/PTSA → MSA/SOW → Marketplace Terms → this Policy → Hub Policies.

---

## 1) Pricing & Plans

* **Base PTSA Seat:** **CAD \$100 per user/month** (baseline). Required for anyone accessing non-public data/repos (see PUOHA/STA/STHCA).
* **Add-ons:** M365 uplifts, GitHub Advanced Security, Render Pro/Plus, observability, storage/egress, backups retention, Enhanced Support, etc.
* **Marketplace items:** Priced per Listing/SOW.

**Price changes:** Base price or catalog rates may change with **30 days’ notice** (future cycles only). Vendor price increases (Microsoft/GitHub/Render/etc.) are **passed through** with notice where practicable.

---

## 2) Billing Cycle & Invoicing

* **Seats (PTSA):** Billed **monthly in advance**; proration **from the add date to month-end**. Removal effective **next cycle**.
* **Add-ons & usage:** Billed **monthly in arrears** based on metering (e.g., build minutes, storage/egress, runner time, Render upgrades).
* **Marketplace Orders:** Charged at purchase or per milestone/SOW.
* **Invoices/receipts:** Posted in Hub and emailed to billing contacts. **Payment terms:** Net **15 days** unless SOW states otherwise.

---

## 3) Payment Methods & Taxes

* **Methods:** Credit/debit card (preferred), ACH/EFT/wire for invoiced accounts.
* **Taxes/withholding:** GST/HST/QST and any applicable sales/value-added taxes are added. Customer is responsible for any withholding; gross-up may apply where legally required.

---

## 4) Late Payments, Suspension & Collections

* **Late fees:** **1.0% per month** (or legal maximum).
* **Suspension:** We may suspend services for undisputed amounts **15+ days** past due (after written notice).
* **Collections:** You agree to pay reasonable collection costs and fees for dishonoured payments/chargebacks.

---

## 5) Cancellations & Refunds

* **Seat cancellations:** Take effect **next billing cycle**. No refunds for the current cycle except where **required by law** or where AliceSolutions terminates for convenience.
* **Add-ons/usage:** Billed through the end of the period in which cancellation occurs.
* **Marketplace:** Refunds/credits follow the **Listing/SOW** and **Marketplace Terms**.
* **SLA credits:** Issued per the **Support SLA**; **applied to future invoices**; not cash.

---

## 6) Disputed Charges

* **Window to dispute:** **15 days** from invoice date. Provide the invoice number, disputed line(s), and rationale. Pay **undisputed** amounts on time. We’ll investigate in good faith within **15 business days** and credit or re-bill as appropriate.

---

## 7) Chargebacks & Fraud

* **Chargebacks** are treated as payment failure and may result in **immediate suspension**. We will contact you to resolve; repeat events may require security deposit, prepayment, or alternate method. We may **claw back** funds or offset against future credits/payouts where permitted. Fraudulent transactions may be referred to payment networks/authorities.

---

## 8) Credits, Promotions & Coupons

* **Promotional credits/coupons** are non-transferable, non-refundable, and **expire in 12 months** unless otherwise stated.
* **SLA credits** (see Support SLA) can’t be stacked beyond stated caps and may not be exchanged for cash.

---

## 9) Usage, Caps & Overages

* **Caps:** You may set per-project monthly spend caps in the Hub. Non-critical workloads may pause at hard caps unless you approve extension.
* **Overages:** Measured at month-end and billed in arrears.
* **Auto-upgrade (optional):** If usage exceeds **120%** for **two consecutive cycles**, you authorize auto-upgrade to the next tier (we’ll notify you).

---

## 10) Marketplace Transactions (Customer)

* **Contracting:** You contract directly with the listing **Provider** unless the Provider is AliceSolutions.
* **Payout timing:** Provider payouts are net of fees/chargebacks as per **Marketplace Terms**.
* **Disputes:** Follow the dispute ladder in Marketplace Terms (Provider → in-Hub escalation → AliceSolutions mediation at our discretion).

---

## 11) Pass-Through Vendors & Outages

* Microsoft/GitHub/Render/observability/backups costs and SLAs **flow through**. Credits received from those vendors for your workloads are passed to you proportionally as **invoice credits**.

---

## 12) Currency, Rounding & FX

* All prices are **CAD** unless specified. Non-CAD payments are converted at processor FX rates and may include FX fees. Line items may round to the nearest cent; metered usage rounds up to the nearest billable unit.

---

## 13) Termination & Offboarding (Billing)

* On account termination, unpaid balances remain due. We will process any outstanding usage/add-on charges and apply due credits. Data export/return and deletion occur per **DPA** and **STHCA**; ensure billing contacts remain reachable during offboarding.

---

## 14) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy for clarity, legal, or operational reasons. Material changes take effect the **next billing cycle** after notice in the Hub/email.
