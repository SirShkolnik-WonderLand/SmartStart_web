ESIGNATURE & ELECTRONIC RECORDS CONSENT
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Governing Law (baseline): Ontario, Canada

**Purpose.** This document explains how AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. (“**AliceSolutions**”) will use **electronic signatures** and **electronic records** with you, and obtains your consent to do business electronically. It applies to all agreements, notices, and records we present through the Hub (collectively, “**Records**”).

> Legal basis: Ontario **Electronic Commerce Act, 2000** (ECA), and where applicable, Canada’s **PIPEDA/PHIPA**. For cross-border signers, substantially similar protections align with U.S. **ESIGN** and **UETA**; EU/UK signers may use e-signature methods recognized under eIDAS where implemented by our provider.

---

## 1) Scope of Your Consent

By agreeing to this Consent, you agree that **all Records between you and AliceSolutions** (and, where indicated, between you and other Hub participants) may be:
(a) provided **electronically**, and (b) **signed electronically** using approved methods, including click-accept, typed name, drawn signature, cryptographic signature, or integrated e-signature envelopes.

Covered Records include, without limitation: PPA, Mutual NDA (Internal), Per-Project NDA Addendum, PCA, JDA, CLA, DPA/DSA, PTSA, STHCA, MSA/SOW/CO, SOBA/PUOHA orders, privacy notices, security acknowledgments, incident or access attestations, offboarding attestations, and any amendments.

Your consent remains in effect until withdrawn (see §6).

## 2) Delivery of Electronic Records

We will deliver Records by: (i) display within the Hub; (ii) email with secure links; (iii) e-signature envelopes; or (iv) API-based workflows. We may ask you to authenticate via SSO/MFA before viewing or signing.

## 3) Electronic Signature Methods We Accept

Any of the following may constitute your **electronic signature**, when captured by our systems:
• Clicking an “I Agree/Accept/Sign” button coupled with your account identity;
• Typing your name in a signature field;
• Drawing your signature with a mouse/stylus;
• Uploading a cryptographic signature or signing via an approved e-signature provider;
• Checking a box that clearly indicates intent to sign, combined with an identity step (MFA).
Each signed Record will include a **signature certificate** (date/time, user/account ID, method, IP/user agent, and, when available, approximate location) and a **cryptographic hash** of the finalized document for tamper evidence.

## 4) Hardware/Software Requirements

To receive, view, and retain Records electronically, you must have:
• A device with a modern browser capable of TLS 1.2+;
• Internet access and a valid email address;
• Ability to view/print/save **PDF** and **HTML**;
• SSO/MFA capability (e.g., authenticator app or security key) for protected Records;
• Sufficient storage to retain copies, or a printer to create paper copies.

**Capability check (tick to confirm):**
☐ I can access and read a sample PDF/HTML in this session.
☐ I can print or save this document for my records.

## 5) Obtaining Paper Copies

You may **request a paper copy** of any Record at any time without withdrawing consent. Requests can be made via the Hub or by email to **legal\@alicesolutions…** Include the Record name and date. Reasonable copy/postage fees may apply where permitted by law. Most Records are downloadable at no charge in the Hub.

## 6) Withdrawing Consent

You may **withdraw** your consent to receive/sign Records electronically at any time by contacting us via the Hub or **privacy\@alicesolutions…**. Withdrawal will be effective **prospectively**; it will **not** affect the legal validity of Records already provided or signed electronically. If you withdraw consent, certain Hub features may be unavailable and processing may be delayed while we arrange paper or alternative methods.

## 7) Updating Your Contact Information

Keep your email and notification preferences **current** in the Hub. We are not responsible for failed delivery if you do not keep your contact details up to date.

## 8) Record Retention

We retain executed Records and signature certificates in secure, tamper-evident storage for at least the periods stated in our **Data Retention Schedule** (longer if law or contract requires). You should also **save or print** copies for your files. Upon request, we can provide a copy and/or a **hash value** to verify integrity.

## 9) Identity, Security & Privacy

• We may require SSO/MFA, knowledge-based steps, or hardware keys to authenticate signers.
• We log access and signature events (time, account ID, IP, user agent) for evidentiary purposes.
• Personal information in Records is handled per our **Privacy Notice** and, if we act as Processor, under the **DPA** (and any PHIPA or GDPR/UK schedules).
• Do not share credentials or sign on unsecured/public devices. Report suspected compromise immediately.

## 10) Accessibility & Accommodations

We aim to provide accessible electronic Records consistent with **AODA/WCAG**. If you need an alternative format or accommodation, contact **accessibility\@alicesolutions…** and we will provide a suitable alternative (e.g., large print, tagged PDFs) without undue delay.

## 11) Cross-Border & Provider Use

We may use vetted **Sub-processors/e-signature providers** to facilitate electronic signing and storage (see Sub-processor Register). Some processing may occur outside your province/country; transfers are governed by our **DPA** (SCCs/UK Addendum where applicable).

## 12) Admissibility; Enforceability

Under the **ECA (Ontario)**, an electronic document or signature **will not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form**. Executed electronic Records, together with signature certificates and logs, constitute **admissible evidence** of agreement and intent to sign.

## 13) Changes to This Consent

We may update this Consent to reflect legal or operational changes. Material changes will be posted in the Hub and, where required, presented for re-consent. Continued electronic signing after notice indicates acceptance of updated terms (where permitted by law).
