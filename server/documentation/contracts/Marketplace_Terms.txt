MARKETPLACE TERMS (Providers & Listings)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub Marketplace
Version: 1.0 • Governing Law: Ontario, Canada

**Read first.** These Terms govern **Providers** who list services, tools, licenses, and expertise in the Hub marketplace, and **Customers** who purchase them. They sit **on top of** the Platform Participation Agreement (PPA) and reference the DPA, PCA/JDA, MSA/SOW, and other Hub policies. When AliceSolutions itself provides a listing, AliceSolutions is the “Provider” for that listing.

---

## 1) Definitions

* **Provider**: A Member (individual or entity) approved to publish marketplace listings and fulfill orders.
* **Customer**: A Member who purchases a listing.
* **Listing**: The page(s) describing the service/tool, with price, scope, SLA, deliverables, and refund/credit terms.
* **Order**: A Customer’s purchase of a Listing, including any add-ons.
* **Work**/**Deliverables**: Outputs created under an Order or SOW.
* **Designated Systems**: The Hub tool stack and approved integrations (M365/Entra SSO+MFA, Intune+Defender, GitHub Org, CI/CD, Secrets Manager, Render.com, backups, DLP).
* **Marketplace Fees**: Commissions, listing fees, payment processing fees, or other charges disclosed in the Hub Pricing page.

**Order of precedence (same subject matter):** Per-Listing SOW/MSA → these Marketplace Terms → PPA → DPA/DSA (for data terms) → other Hub policies.

---

## 2) Scope & Eligibility

2.1 **Scope.** The marketplace facilitates introductions and commerce between Providers and Customers. AliceSolutions is not a party to Orders **unless** AliceSolutions is the Provider.
2.2 **Eligibility.** Providers must pass **KYC/identity verification**, hold valid business registrations (where required), be **tax-compliant**, and accept applicable **DPA/DSA** and security requirements. AliceSolutions may approve or deny Providers or Listings at its discretion.
2.3 **Sanctions & Compliance.** Providers and Customers represent they are not prohibited persons and will comply with export control, anti-bribery, and sanctions laws.

---

## 3) Listings: Content, Accuracy, & Versioning

3.1 **Required elements.** Each Listing must include: scope, prerequisites, **clear deliverables**, acceptance criteria, SLA/response times, timeline windows, pricing & unit(s), refund/credit policy, Warranty window (if any), and any dependencies on Customer inputs.
3.2 **Accuracy & updates.** Providers must keep Listings accurate and versioned. Material changes apply **prospectively** and do not affect existing Orders unless the Customer agrees in writing (Hub click-accept or SOW change order).
3.3 **Prohibited Listings.** No illegal, unsafe, or policy-violating offers; no resale of third-party rights without authorization; no Listings that require data handling the DPA forbids without pre-approval.

---

## 4) Ordering, Contracts & Change Control

4.1 **Instant Orders vs. SOW.** Simple Listings may be bought “as described.” Complex work requires an **MSA/SOW** that references the Listing.
4.2 **Change control.** Changes to scope, price, or schedule require a **written change order** (CO) accepted in the Hub.
4.3 **Acceptance.** Customer will accept/reject each deliverable within the **Review Window** stated in the Listing/SOW (default **5 business days**) with reasons tied to acceptance criteria. Silence ⇒ deemed accepted.

---

## 5) Fees, Commissions, Payouts & Taxes

5.1 **Marketplace Fees.** AliceSolutions may charge commissions and/or listing fees as published in the **Hub Pricing** page. We may adjust fees with notice (future Orders only).
5.2 **Payouts to Providers.** Unless a SOW specifies otherwise, payouts occur **net of** Marketplace Fees, taxes withheld (if any), **chargebacks**, refunds/credits, and **fraud/risk holds**. Standard payout timing is **within 7–14 business days** after Customer payment and/or milestone acceptance.
5.3 **Reserves & Clawbacks.** We may hold a reasonable **reserve** for new Providers, high-risk categories, or disputed Orders. If a chargeback/refund later occurs, we may **claw back** amounts from future payouts or require repayment.
5.4 **Currency & Taxes.** Prices are shown in **CAD** unless stated otherwise. Applicable taxes (GST/HST/QST) are added at checkout. Providers are responsible for their own income, sales, and indirect taxes and for issuing tax invoices when required.

---

## 6) Performance, SLAs & Support

6.1 **SLA Ownership.** Provider is **first-line support** for its Listing. Response/resolve targets must be stated (e.g., P1 within 4 hours, P2 within 1 business day).
6.2 **Failure to perform.** If Provider cannot meet commitments, it must promptly notify Customer and propose a remedy (re-perform, partial refund, or credit). Repeated failure may trigger removal (§10).

---

## 7) Independence & Non-Circumvention

7.1 **Independent contractor.** Providers are independent of AliceSolutions and Customers; no employment, partnership, or agency is created by these Terms.
7.2 **Non-circumvention.** During an active Order and for **6 months** thereafter, Provider and Customer will not knowingly circumvent the marketplace for equivalent scope to avoid Marketplace Fees, unless (a) a separate enterprise agreement with AliceSolutions covers it, or (b) AliceSolutions provides written consent.

---

## 8) Data, Confidentiality & Security

8.1 **Confidentiality.** Provider and Customer are bound by the **Mutual NDA (Internal)** and any relevant **Per-Project NDA Addendum (security-tiered)** before exchanging non-public materials.
8.2 **DPA/DSA.**

* If Provider **processes Customer Personal Information**, the **DPA** (Controller→Processor) applies.
* If participants share PI **controller-to-controller**, a **Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)** is required.
  8.3 **Security & Tools.** Work must occur only in **Designated Systems**; device compliance (Intune + Defender) and SSO+MFA are required for non-public data. No secrets in repos/logs; use the Secrets Manager.
  8.4 **Records.** Providers will keep reasonable records of fulfillment and security compliance for audit and dispute resolution.

---

## 9) IP & Licenses

9.1 **Deliverables IP.** IP outcomes follow the **Listing** and, if present, the **MSA/SOW**:

* **Assignment on payment** (common for bespoke work); or
* **License to use** (common for reusable templates/tools).
  9.2 **Background IP.** Each party retains its background IP and grants the other only the scope listed in the Listing/SOW to use background components embedded in the Deliverables.
  9.3 **OSS Hygiene.** Providers warrant compliance with open-source licenses; no copyleft code (e.g., AGPL) in distributed builds without prior written approval and proper notices.
  9.4 **No malware / clean rights.** Providers warrant Deliverables are malware-free and that they have rights to all materials supplied.

---

## 10) Ratings, Ranking & Removal

10.1 **Ratings/Reviews.** AliceSolutions may publish ratings and qualitative feedback. By listing, Providers consent to fair publication of marketplace ratings.
10.2 **Ranking.** Search ranking may use performance, quality signals, dispute history, and fit to Customer needs.
10.3 **Removal / Suspension.** We may remove or suspend a Listing or Provider for low performance, policy violations, IP claims, fraud risk, or legal risk.

---

## 11) Disputes, Refunds, Credits

11.1 **Dispute ladder.** (1) Provider↔Customer resolution; (2) escalate in-Hub; (3) AliceSolutions **may** mediate (discretionary).
11.2 **Refunds/Credits.** Listing/SOW governs. If unresolved and risk of harm exists, AliceSolutions may issue credits, pause payouts, or reverse charges, acting reasonably and proportionately.
11.3 **Chargebacks.** If a chargeback occurs, Provider will cooperate in evidence submission; AliceSolutions may offset future payouts.

---

## 12) Termination

12.1 **By AliceSolutions.** We may suspend or terminate Provider access or Listings for breach, risk, legal requirement, or repeated poor performance.
12.2 **Effect.** Surviving obligations: confidentiality, IP terms for accepted Deliverables, data protection, dispute cooperation, and outstanding fees or clawbacks.
12.3 **Customer Orders.** Termination of a Listing does not by itself cancel active, accepted Orders; those continue under the applicable Listing/SOW unless the parties agree otherwise or we determine risk requires cancellation.

---

## 13) Warranties; Indemnities; Limits

13.1 **Provider warranties.** Rights to perform; conformance to Listing/SOW; no malware; compliance with laws and licenses.
13.2 **Indemnity.** Provider will indemnify Customer and AliceSolutions for third-party claims arising from (a) Provider’s Deliverables infringing IP or violating law, or (b) Provider’s breach of these Terms, excluding combinations not supplied by Provider.
13.3 **Limitations.** To the maximum extent permitted by law: no party is liable for indirect or consequential damages. AliceSolutions’ aggregate liability related to marketplace facilitation is capped at the higher of **CAD \$5,000** or **Marketplace Fees paid by the Provider in the prior 6 months**, except for willful misconduct or obligations that cannot be limited by law.

---

## 14) Privacy, Notices & E-Sign

14.1 **Privacy.** Personal information is handled per the **Privacy Notice** and **DPA/DSA** as applicable.
14.2 **Notices.** Official notices may be delivered via the Hub or email to registered contacts.
14.3 **E-Sign.** Electronic signatures/records are valid per the **ESignature Consent**.

---

## 15) Miscellaneous

15.1 **No assignment** by Providers without consent, except to a successor that assumes obligations.
15.2 **Severability.** If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.
15.3 **Changes.** We may update these Terms with notice in the Hub; changes apply to future Listings/Orders.
15.4 **Governing law & venue.** **Ontario, Canada**; courts of **Toronto, Ontario**.
