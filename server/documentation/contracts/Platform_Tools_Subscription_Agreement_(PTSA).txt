Below are **two sign-ready, plain-text documents** you can paste into the Hub. They’re Ontario/Canada-oriented, align with your PPA/NDA/DPA stack, and make (1) the **\$100 CAD/mo mandatory tools subscription** a gating requirement, and (2) enforce **standardized tooling** (Microsoft 365 domain, Intune/Defender, backups, GitHub org, Render.com hosting, etc.).
*Not legal advice—have counsel review before first use.*

PLATFORM TOOLS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (PTSA)
(AliceSolutions Hub – Mandatory “365 + Security + Backups” Pack)
Version: 1.0

1. PARTIES; EFFECTIVE DATE
   This Platform Tools Subscription Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the date of the last signature below (“Effective Date”) by and between:
   (a) **AliceSolutions Ventures Inc.** (“AliceSolutions”, “we/us”); and
   (b) The Hub member identified on the signature page (“Subscriber”, “you”).

2. PURPOSE; GATING CONDITION
   2.1 Purpose. To enable secure collaboration in the Hub, AliceSolutions provides a standardized tools bundle (the “**Platform Pack**”) including Microsoft 365 services, security controls, device management, and backups.
   2.2 Mandatory. **Active subscription to the Platform Pack is required** for any user who accesses non-public projects, submits offers, is provisioned to repos/environments, or otherwise collaborates inside the Hub. No subscription → **no access** (except public previews).

3. SERVICES INCLUDED (Platform Pack)
   3.1 Core Suite (Microsoft 365): organization email (@{your-project-domain}), calendaring, contacts, Teams/meetings, OneDrive/SharePoint, collaboration apps.
   3.2 Identity & Security: Azure AD/Entra ID SSO, MFA, Conditional Access; **Microsoft Intune** device management (MDM/MAM) for enrolled devices; **Microsoft Defender** (endpoint, identity, email).
   3.3 Backups & Continuity: managed **M365 backups** (mail/SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams) and **endpoint backup** for enrolled devices (where technically feasible).
   3.4 Administration: account provisioning, license assignment, baseline security policies, access reviews, and revocation on exit.
   3.5 Add-Ons (project-driven): at Subscriber’s request/approval, AliceSolutions may procure additional SaaS or higher-tier licenses (e.g., GitHub Enterprise, Render.com tiers, scanners, monitoring). Add-Ons are billed **at pass-through cost** (plus applicable taxes/fees); separate approvals recorded in the Hub.

4. FEES; BILLING; TAXES
   4.1 Price. **CAD \$100 per active seat per month** (the “Base Seat Fee”). Taxes extra.
   4.2 Auto-Renew. Billed monthly in advance; renews until cancelled under §10.
   4.3 Proration. Seats activated mid-cycle are prorated; deactivations take effect end of current cycle.
   4.4 Payment Failure. If payment fails and isn’t cured within **5 days**, we may suspend the seat and downstream access (including repos/environments) until resolved.
   4.5 Price Changes. We may change the Base Seat Fee with **30 days’ notice**; you may cancel before the effective date. Continued use after the effective date = acceptance.
   4.6 Add-Ons. Add-Ons are invoiced as incurred or monthly in arrears.
   4.7 Non-Refundable. Fees for the current month are **non-refundable** unless required by law.

5. SUBSCRIBER DUTIES
   5.1 Eligibility. Seats are **named users** (no sharing). Subscriber ensures users follow Hub security policies and enroll devices in Intune per §6.
   5.2 Accurate Info. Keep billing, company, and contact details current.
   5.3 Compliance. Follow Microsoft product terms and any third-party terms for components included in the Platform Pack.

6. DEVICE & SECURITY POSTURE (Zero-Trust Baseline)
   6.1 MFA is mandatory on all tenant accounts.
   6.2 Device Management. Any device accessing non-public project data must be **enrolled in Intune** (or an approved managed profile) with: full-disk encryption, screen lock, OS and security patches current, and Defender/EDR active.
   6.3 Conditional Access may block access on non-compliant devices, risky sign-ins, or prohibited geographies.
   6.4 Data Handling. Use only **Designated Systems**; do not forward Hub mail to personal accounts; do not store project material outside approved locations; respect DLP/watermarks.

7. SUPPORT; SLAS; MAINTENANCE
   7.1 Support windows and response targets are published in the Hub; maintenance windows may apply.
   7.2 Microsoft/third-party outages are out of scope for our SLAs; we’ll coordinate commercially reasonable escalations.

8. DATA; PRIVACY; BACKUPS
   8.1 Ownership. Subscriber retains ownership of its data; AliceSolutions acts per the **DPA** for processing.
   8.2 Backups. We operate reasonable backup policies for included services; restore is subject to technical feasibility and retention limits.
   8.3 Offboarding. On termination or seat removal, we will disable access, retain data per policy/contract, and, upon request, provide reasonable export **or** deletion, subject to lawful retention and technical limits.

9. ACCEPTABLE USE
   No credential sharing, scraping, circumvention of DLP, or unapproved third-party integrations. Follow anti-abuse and security rules published in the Hub.

10. TERM; SUSPENSION; TERMINATION
    10.1 Term. Month-to-month from Effective Date.
    10.2 Subscriber Cancellation. You may cancel seats effective end of current cycle via the Hub.
    10.3 Suspension. We may suspend for non-payment, security risk, or material breach.
    10.4 Termination. Either party may terminate on **30 days’ notice**; we may terminate immediately for uncured material breach or legal/safety reasons.
    10.5 Effect. Access is revoked; §8 survives; fees through the end of the cycle remain due.

11. LIABILITY (CAP & EXCLUSIONS)
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party is liable for indirect/special/consequential damages. Each party’s aggregate liability arising from this Agreement is capped at **the greater of (a) CAD \$5,000; or (b) the Base Seat Fees paid in the 6 months** preceding the event, **except** for fraud or wilful misconduct, or Subscriber’s breaches of security/acceptable use causing third-party claims.

12. GOVERNING LAW; E-SIGNATURE
    Ontario law; Toronto courts (exclusive). Electronic signatures/records are binding.

13. ORDER OF PRECEDENCE
    For tools/billing: **this PTSA → DPA (data) → PPA → NDA/Addenda → Hub policies** (subject-matter specific).

STANDARDIZED TOOLING & HOSTING COMPLIANCE ADDENDUM (STHCA)
(Projects inside the AliceSolutions Hub)
Version: 1.0

1. PURPOSE
   This Addendum mandates **common tools and environments** for all projects to reduce risk and enable support at scale. It binds project participants and project owners and supplements the PPA/NDA/Per-Project Addendum and the PTSA.

2. SCOPE; PRECEDENCE
   For any non-public project: **this STHCA → Per-Project Addendum → NDA → PPA/PTSA → Hub policies** (tooling/hosting subject matter).

3. STANDARD TOOLING (MANDATORY)
   3.1 **Email & Identity**: All project communications use the **AliceSolutions-managed Microsoft 365 tenant** and project domain addresses. No personal emails or external aliases for project business.
   3.2 **Device & Security**: Devices must be **Intune-enrolled** (or approved managed profile) and protected by **Microsoft Defender**; Conditional Access may block non-compliant endpoints.
   3.3 **Source Control**: All repos reside in the **AliceSolutions GitHub Organization**. No external repos for project code/assets. Access via SSO; branch protection and required reviews enforced.
   3.4 **CI/CD & Secrets**: Use the **approved CI/CD pipelines** and the **Designated Secrets Manager**. No secrets in code, tickets, or chat.
   3.5 **Hosting/Runtime**: Default deployment on **Render.com** under AliceSolutions-managed accounts/spaces. Project owners may choose higher-tier or additional Render.com services according to need and budget.
   3.6 **Backups & Observability**: Use platform-approved backup jobs, logs, metrics, and alerting.
   3.7 **DLP**: Respect watermarks, export limits, and content scanning in all tools.

4. COSTS; BILLING LOGIC
   4.1 Base Seat Fees. Each active collaborator must maintain a PTSA seat (CAD \$100/mo, taxes extra).
   4.2 Project-Level Upgrades. If a project requires paid upgrades (e.g., Render.com Pro or Autoscale, GitHub Advanced Security, higher database tiers), the **Project Owner** designates a payer (owner, venture budget, or cost-share across team).
   4.3 Pass-Through. Tooling/hosting upgrades are billed **at pass-through cost** (plus applicable taxes/fees). The payer agrees to monthly charges until downgraded or project closure.
   4.4 Future Changes. Standard tools may evolve; materially different tools will be notified in advance, and costs disclosed before enablement.

5. EXCEPTIONS PROCESS
   5.1 Requests. A Project Lead may request a tooling exception in the Hub (business need, security impact, duration, cost).
   5.2 Approvals. Security reviews Tier 2/3 data exceptions; Legal reviews data residency/processor terms. Approved exceptions are **time-boxed** and recorded in the project’s **Exception Log (Schedule C)**.
   5.3 Revocation. Exceptions may be revoked for security, cost, or compliance reasons.

6. ENFORCEMENT & ACCESS
   6.1 Provisioning ties to compliance. Non-compliant users/tools are blocked by policy (SSO/Conditional Access, org restrictions, environment policy).
   6.2 Violations (e.g., external repos, personal email, unmanaged devices) may trigger suspension until corrected and can lead to removal from the project.

7. DATA RESIDENCY & PRIVACY
   7.1 Default residency is **Canada** unless the Per-Project Addendum allows otherwise.
   7.2 Any additional processors (Render.com tiers, GitHub features, scanners) must be listed in the project’s Sub-processor register and covered by DPA terms.

8. DELIVERY & RELEASE PRACTICES
   8.1 Branching, reviews, SBOMs, and security scans per project policy.
   8.2 Production releases require: (i) passing checks; (ii) change record; (iii) rollback plan; (iv) secrets injected from the approved manager only.

9. TERMINATION; OFFBOARDING
   9.1 On exit, users lose access and must return/delete local data not in Designated Systems; repos remain under the org.
   9.2 We will provide reasonable data exports for the project owner upon closure, subject to DPA/NDA and lawful retention.

10. LIABILITY; REMEDIES
    Breach of tooling/hosting controls can cause material risk; AliceSolutions and/or the Project Owner may seek **injunctive** relief and recover direct damages caused by non-compliance. Caps/exclusions in the PPA/PTSA apply except for wilful misconduct or security breaches caused by circumvention.

11. GOVERNING LAW; E-SIGNATURE
    Ontario law; Toronto courts (exclusive). Electronic signatures/records are binding.
