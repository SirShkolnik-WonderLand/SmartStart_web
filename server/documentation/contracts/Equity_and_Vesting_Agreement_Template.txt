   • Approve designs/PRs within \_\_\_ business days.
   • Supply sample/test data free of regulated content unless pre-approved.
   • Decision maker(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

• Data residency / environments provisioned by: ☐ Customer ☐ Provider.

6. FEES & PAYMENT
   6.1 **Pricing Model:** ☐ Fixed Price ☐ Time & Materials (T\&M) ☐ Hybrid

* If **Fixed**: Total CAD $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (excl. tax).
* If **T\&M**: Rate card (see Schedule C) with cap CAD $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ unless Customer approves increases in writing.

6.5 **Payment Terms:** Net \_\_\_ days from invoice. Late amounts may accrue interest at \_\_\_% per month (maximum permitted by law).

7. CHANGE CONTROL
   All scope/schedule/fee changes require a written **Change Order (CO-###)** signed by both parties. Each CO states: change description, rationale, impact on cost/timeline/risks, and acceptance criteria updates. No work proceeds against unapproved changes.

8. IP & LICENSE (select one)
   ☐ **Assignment on payment** — Upon acceptance and full payment, Foreground IP in Deliverables is assigned to the **Project Owner/NewCo/Customer** (specify: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_). Provider retains Background IP and grants a non-exclusive license for embedded Background components strictly as used in the Deliverables.
   ☐ **License to use** — Provider retains ownership of Deliverables and grants the Project Owner/NewCo/Customer a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license (with sublicense rights to affiliates/customers) to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Deliverables.
   **Background IP Schedule** (complete Schedule D): list components, versions, licenses, and scope. **OSS hygiene:** allow-list only; no copyleft (e.g., AGPL) in distributed builds without written approval. **CLA inbound** applies for individual contributions where relevant.

9. PRIVACY, SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
   9.1 **DPA** applies if any Personal Information/PHI is processed.
   9.2 **Security Tier:** T\_\_ (T1/T2/T3). **Residency:** ☐ Canada (default) ☐ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
   9.3 **Sub-processors involved:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (or “See Sub-processor Register”).
   9.4 **Controls:** Entra ID SSO+MFA; Intune+Defender; secrets via manager; TLS in transit; encryption at rest; logging/monitoring per Logging Standard; backups/DR; DLP.
   9.5 **Artifacts:** attach DPIA/ROPA if applicable.

10. ACCEPTANCE & WARRANTY
    10.1 **Review Window:** Customer will accept or reject each deliverable within **5 business days** of submission, giving specific reasons and defects tied to acceptance criteria. Silence after the window = **deemed accepted**.
    10.2 **Remedy:** Provider will remedy verified defects within a commercially reasonable period (default **5–10 business days**, depending on severity).
    10.3 **Warranty Period:** **30 days** after acceptance per deliverable — defect fixes at no additional charge for items not caused by out-of-scope changes or third-party failures. (Longer warranty may be specified here: \_\_\_\_\_\_.)

11. SERVICE MANAGEMENT & COMMUNICATION
    • **Cadence:** Weekly stand-up; bi-weekly status report (burn-down, risks, decisions).
    • **Issue/Risk Log:** Maintained in the Hub; blockers escalated within 1 business day.
    • **Decision Register:** Key decisions recorded in tickets/PRs or minutes.
    • **Change Freeze Windows:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (if any).

12. RISK, QUALITY & TESTING
    • **Quality gates:** Lint, unit/integration tests (≥ \_\_\_% coverage), SAST/dep scan clean, SBOM on release, artifact signing.
    • **Performance gates:** p95 ≤ \_\_\_ ms at \_\_\_ RPS on staging; error rate ≤ \_\_\_%.
    • **Rollbacks:** Verified rollback plan per release; canary where feasible.

13. SUSPENSION, TERMINATION & OFFBOARDING
    As per the MSA. On termination or completion: hand over code, configs, runbooks, credentials (via Secrets Manager), and close out **Exit Checklist** (access removal, secret rotations, data return/delete with **Attestation**). Post-project assistance up to **\_\_\_ hours** at the applicable rate unless otherwise agreed.

14. ORDER OF PRECEDENCE
    For the same subject matter: **Change Orders → this SOW → MSA → DPA → PCA/JDA (IP for joint builds) → CLA inbound (for contributor rights) → Hub policies**. If a JDA assigns IP, that JDA controls IP ownership for the covered work.
