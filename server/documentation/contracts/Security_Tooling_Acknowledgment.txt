SECURITY TOOLING ACKNOWLEDGMENT (STA)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Governing Law (baseline): Ontario, Canada

**Purpose.** This acknowledgment confirms that you understand and agree to use the **standardized, secured tool stack** and comply with AliceSolutions’ security controls when accessing **non-public Hub/venture resources**. It sits alongside the **Platform Participation Agreement (PPA)**, **Mutual NDA (Internal)**, **Per-Project NDA Addendum (tiered)**, **PTSA** (Platform Tools Subscription Addendum), **STHCA** (Standardized Tooling & Hosting Compliance Addendum), **DPA/DSA** (as applicable), and relevant security policies (Access Control & BYOD, Logging & Monitoring, Incident Response, Secrets/Key Management, Vulnerability & Patch).

> **Gate:** Access to any non-public project or data requires (i) acceptance of this STA, (ii) an active PTSA seat, and (iii) a **compliant device**.

---

## 1) Definitions (summary)

* **Designated Systems**: Hub-approved tenants and services: **M365 (Entra ID SSO+MFA, Exchange/Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive), Intune & Defender**, **GitHub Org (SSO)**, approved **CI/CD runners**, **Designated Secrets Manager**, **Render.com** hosting, approved **observability/backup** providers.
* **Compliant Device**: A device enrolled in **Intune**, healthy in **Defender EDR**, disk-encrypted, patched, and meeting policy baselines.
* **Security Tiers**: T1/T2/T3 — the **highest tier touching any data controls** the handling rules.

---

## 2) What You Must Use (Required Tool Stack)

By signing, you confirm you will use **only** the following for Hub work and project data:

1. **Identity & Email**: M365 account under Hub domain; **Entra ID SSO + MFA**; Conditional Access.
2. **Endpoint**: **Intune-enrolled** device with **Defender EDR**; disk encryption; screen lock; auto-update.
3. **Source & CI/CD**: **GitHub Org (SSO)**, protected branches, required reviews, secret scanning; approved runners only.
4. **Secrets**: **Designated Secrets Manager**; no secrets in code, tickets, chat, or logs.
5. **Hosting**: **Render.com** services provisioned via the Hub; configs/secrets injected at runtime.
6. **Storage & Sharing**: **SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams** within the Hub tenant; **no personal drives/emails**.
7. **Backups/Observability**: As configured by the Hub; do not disable or bypass.
8. **DLP/Export controls**: Respect email/file **DLP** and watermarking; tier-based print/export rules apply.

---

## 3) Your Commitments (tick all)

\[  ] **C1. Device compliance.** I will access non-public data **only from compliant devices** (Intune + Defender healthy).
\[  ] **C2. SSO/MFA.** I will not bypass SSO/MFA or share accounts/tokens.
\[  ] **C3. Secrets.** I will use the **Secrets Manager** and rotate on signal; no secrets in repos, tickets, or chat.
\[  ] **C4. Data location.** I will **keep project data inside Designated Systems**; no personal email/cloud, no unsanctioned tools.
\[  ] **C5. DLP & exports.** I will follow tier rules for print/export/sharing and obtain approvals where required.
\[  ] **C6. Logging.** I understand security **logging/monitoring** is enabled (identity, repo, CI, runtime) for defense/audit.
\[  ] **C7. Updates.** I will install required OS/app updates and not postpone security patches beyond policy windows.
\[  ] **C8. Incidents.** I will **report** suspected compromise, lost devices, or data mishandling **immediately** via the Hub.
\[  ] **C9. Exceptions.** I will request **time-boxed exceptions** only via the Security Exception process and respect compensating controls.
\[  ] **C10. Exit.** On exit/role change I will complete the **Exit Attestation**, return/delete local data, and cease access.

---

## 4) BYOD Consent (if you use a personal device for Hub work)

If you use a personal device, check each to consent:

\[  ] **B1. Work Profile/MDM.** I consent to installation of **Intune** MDM/work profile and baseline policies.
\[  ] **B2. Limited monitoring.** I understand only **work profile posture** and security signals are monitored; personal content is not inspected.
\[  ] **B3. Remote actions.** I consent to **selective wipe** (work profile/apps/data) if the device is lost/stolen, on exit, or for policy breach.
\[  ] **B4. Storage rules.** I will not store project data outside the managed work profile or approved containers.
\[  ] **B5. Prohibited actions.** I will not jailbreak/root or disable EDR/MDM.

> If you do **not** consent to BYOD terms, you must use a **corporate-managed** device to access non-public data.

---

## 5) Data Handling & Tiered Restrictions (summary)

* **T1 (internal)**: Standard controls; printing/export allowed with business need; no secrets in logs; DLP advisory banners.
* **T2 (confidential)**: Printing/export **approval-only**; sharing limited to named groups; PII allowed only under **DPA/DSA**; no third-party email.
* **T3 (restricted / crown-jewel)**: **No printing/export** unless CISO-approved with compensating controls; access from **compliant devices only**; repository access via protected branches and signed artifacts; production data access requires ticket + JIT elevation.

(Full matrix in **STHCA** & **Data Classification Standard**.)

---

## 6) Prohibited Practices (non-exhaustive)

* Storing or forwarding project data via **personal** email or drives.
* Committing **secrets** or regulated data to repos, tickets, chat, or logs.
* Running CI/CD from **unapproved** self-hosted runners for T3 workloads.
* Disabling or tampering with **EDR/MDM/DLP/logging**.
* Using **unlicensed** or **copyleft-incompatible** components in distributed builds without written approval.
* Circumventing **spending caps** or launching unmanaged cloud resources.

---

## 7) Monitoring & Privacy Notice (transparency)

* The Hub collects **security telemetry** (auth events, device posture, repo/CI signals, runtime alerts) to protect data and meet audit requirements.
* Content inspection is **limited** to security functions (e.g., secret scanning, malware detection, DLP).
* Personal information is handled per the **Privacy Notice** and, where we act as Processor, under the **DPA**.

---

## 8) Exceptions & Waivers

* **Process:** Submit a Security Exception ticket stating need, scope, duration (≤ **30 days**), compensating controls, and approver.
* **Approvals:** CISO (or delegate) must approve. Exceptions are **revocable** and logged in the **Exception Register**.
* **Auto-expire** with reminders at 7/3/1 days before expiry.

---

## 9) Violations & Enforcement

* **Progressive actions:** coaching → warning → **access suspension** → removal from project; severe or willful breaches may trigger **immediate suspension** and legal remedies.
* Costs to investigate/remediate caused by willful breach may be **charged back** where contractually permitted.

---

## 10) Offboarding

* Access is removed; tokens revoked; groups cleared; **secrets rotated**.
* You must sign the **Exit Attestation** confirming return/deletion of data outside Designated Systems.
* Retention of records follows the **Data Retention & Deletion Schedule**.

## 11) Acknowledgment & Signature (e-sign permitted)
