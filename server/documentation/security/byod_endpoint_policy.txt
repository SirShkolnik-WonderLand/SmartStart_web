BYOD & ENDPOINT SECURITY POLICY
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Owner: CISO • Effective: on publication

0) PURPOSE & SCOPE
Define minimum security requirements for ANY endpoint (laptop, desktop, mobile, tablet, VM/thin client) that accesses non-public Hub data. Applies to employees, contractors, advisors, and venture participants. Enforce the HIGHEST data tier (T0–T3) present.

0.1 REFERENCES
• Security Controls Master (SC-25) • Access Control Policy • Incident Response Plan
• Logging & Monitoring Standard • Data Classification Standard • STHCA

1) MODELS
• **Corporate-Managed (Preferred):** Full MDM via Intune, Defender EDR, device compliance policies enforced.
• **BYOD (Permitted with Controls):**
  - **Mobile:** App Protection Policies (MAM) + Conditional Access; no device-wide MDM if user opts MAM-only (T1/T2 only).
  - **Laptop/Desktop:** BYOD allowed only if FULL Intune enrollment is accepted (T2/T3). T3 BYOD discouraged; approval required.

2) BASELINE REQUIREMENTS (ALL ENDPOINTS)
2.1 Identity: Unique user; MFA required; no shared local accounts.
2.2 Encryption: Full-disk encryption (BitLocker/FileVault) enabled and escrowed to Intune.
2.3 OS & Patch: Supported OS versions only. Automatic updates on. Patch SLO: Critical within 7 days (T1), 3 days (T2), 24–72h (T3).
2.4 EDR: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint active and reporting healthy; tamper protection on.
2.5 Firewall: OS firewall enabled; no inbound rules except managed profiles.
2.6 Screen Lock: Auto-lock ≤ 10 minutes; password/biometric required on wake.
2.7 Backups: Endpoint user data protected where technically feasible per PTSA; sensitive work should reside in OneDrive/SharePoint, not only local.
2.8 USB/Removable Media: Blocked by default for T2/T3; allow via exception with encryption and logging.
2.9 Prohibited Software: Torrent clients, unauthorized remote control, unauthorized cloud sync (e.g., personal Dropbox/Google Drive), crypto-miners, jailbreak/root tools.
2.10 Data Handling: No personal email forwarding; use Designated Systems only; local storage minimized; printing controlled (T2 approval-only; T3 forbidden).
2.11 Browser: Latest stable; password managers allowed if enterprise approved; disable saving corporate passwords to unmanaged stores.

3) MOBILE SPECIFIC
• iOS/iPadOS/Android: OS supported; device lock + biometrics; jailbreak/root detection (block access).
• Managed apps must use App Protection Policies: require PIN/biometric, encrypt app data at rest, block copy/paste to unmanaged, wipe on device compromise.

4) NETWORK
• Public Wi-Fi acceptable for T1/T2 only with encrypted transport; T3 requires VPN to approved gateway.
• Block risky geographies via Conditional Access as determined by CISO.

5) COMPLIANCE & CONDITIONAL ACCESS
• Non-compliant or unknown devices are **blocked** from T2/T3 resources.
• Compliance signals include: encryption on, EDR healthy, OS version supported, screen lock set, jailbreak/root status, no high-risk posture.
• Device compliance state is visible in the Hub’s security dashboard.

6) LOCAL ADMIN RIGHTS
• Corporate devices: no local admin by default. Temporary admin via Just-in-Time request (≤ 2h T2, ≤ 1h T3) with logged reason.
• BYOD laptops enrolled in Intune: local admin allowed only if control objectives are still met; monitored.

7) LOST/STOLEN/COMPROMISED
• Report to Security within **1 hour** of discovery (sooner for T3).
• Security may remotely wipe corporate profiles/data; user consents to selective wipe for MAM and full wipe for corporate-owned devices.
• Rotate credentials/secrets used on the device; create incident ticket; follow IRP.

8) EXCEPTIONS
• Request via Hub: reason, duration (≤ 30 days for device exceptions), mitigation (e.g., hardened VDI), owner, tier. CISO approval required; Legal if privacy/residency impacted.
• Standing exceptions are prohibited. Auto-reminders at 7/3/1 days; revoke on expiry.

9) PRIVACY (BYOD)
• We collect device compliance posture, OS version, security status, and managed app telemetry — not personal photos, texts, or personal app content.
• Selective wipe removes only corporate data/managed apps.
• Privacy notice available in the Hub; consent recorded at enrollment.

10) AUDIT EVIDENCE
• Intune compliance reports; Defender coverage dashboards; device inventory; exception log; remote wipe records; patch compliance reports; CA policy exports.

11) ENFORCEMENT
• Non-compliant endpoints are blocked; repeated or wilful violations may lead to removal from projects and revocation of Hub access. Security can quarantine devices per Defender/Intune.

12) MINIMUMS BY TIER (SUMMARY)
• T1: Encryption, MFA, EDR, patch ≤7d, MAM for mobile OK.
• T2: Full Intune enrollment (laptop/desktop), Defender EDR, patch ≤3d, USB blocked, CA require compliant device.
• T3: Intune + Defender + FIDO2; VPN for admin/management paths; patch 24–72h; no BYOD without CISO exception; print/export forbidden; screen recording controls where feasible.

13) VERSIONING & REVIEW
• Changes via PR; CISO approval. Next review: 12 months or after Sev-1 endpoint incident.

CHANGE LOG
• v1.0 — Initial BYOD/Endpoint baseline aligned with PTSA/STHCA and tier matrix.
