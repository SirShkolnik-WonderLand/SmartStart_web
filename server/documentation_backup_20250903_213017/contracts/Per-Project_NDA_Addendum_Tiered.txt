Per-Project NDA Addendum (Security-Tiered)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. (“AliceSolutions”) — Project-Level Addendum to Mutual NDA
Project Name / ID: __________________________
Effective Date: __________________________
Parties Covered: AliceSolutions; all Participants bound by the Platform NDA and PPA who are approved for this Project (“Project Participants”).
Relationship to Other Docs: This Addendum supplements and controls for this Project if it conflicts with the Platform NDA or PPA.
1) Purpose & Scope
This Addendum sets project-specific confidentiality, security, and handling rules based on the Project’s Security Tier. It defines Designated Systems, Permitted Tools, Access Grants, Data Classes, and Exit duties. No access to non-public project materials is permitted until this Addendum is signed.
2) Data Classification & Security Tiers
Choose the highest tier that applies to any data a Participant will access. Controls for higher tiers include all controls of lower tiers unless expressly relaxed.
Tier 0 — Public
Non-confidential, intentionally public content (marketing, open docs).
Tier 1 — Confidential (Internal)
Non-public business information (plans, drafts, non-sensitive code, non-identifiable logs).
Tier 2 — Restricted (Sensitive Commercial)
Trade secrets, customer lists, financials, security architecture, credentials, production code, or personal information where present.
Tier 3 — Highly Restricted (Critical/Regulated)
Crown-jewel IP, unlaunched product code/keys, acquisitions, large-scale personal information (incl. sensitive), or personal health information (PHI); data whose disclosure could cause material harm.
Note: Where personal information is involved, safeguards must be appropriate to sensitivity (PIPEDA Principle 7). For e-signatures, Ontario’s ECA recognizes electronic signatures for legal requirement to sign, subject to exceptions. If PHI is processed, PHIPA obligations apply (security, consent, access, breach handling).

IDEs, build tools, scanners, AI/LLM providers (if allowed), etc.: ______________________
3.3 Change Control: Any addition/substitution requires written approval by Project Lead (and Legal if Tier 2/3), recorded in the Hub. Unapproved tools are prohibited.
4) Access Provisioning & RBAC
4.1 Least-Privilege Grants: Access is role-based and limited to minimum necessary repositories, environments, and datasets.
4.2 Expiry & Review:
Tier 1: expiry ≤ 90 days; review every 90 days
Tier 2: expiry ≤ 60 days; review every 60 days
Tier 3: expiry ≤ 30 days; review every 30 days
4.3 Elevation: Temporary elevation requires second reviewer (Lead + Security) and auto-reverts.
4.4 Suspension/Revocation: Access may be paused or revoked at any time to protect security or comply with law/policy.
5) Endpoint, Identity & Network Controls
5.1 Identity: MFA required on all accounts; hardware security keys (FIDO2) required for Tier 3.
5.2 Devices:
Tier 1: Supported OS, full-disk encryption, auto-lock ≤ 5 min.
Tier 2: Above + OS patching ≤ 30 days; EDR/AV; screen-lock privacy; no shared accounts.
Tier 3: Managed devices only (MDM enrolled); EDR; disk encryption; USB write disabled; clipboard and screen-recording blocked where feasible; no jailbroken/rooted devices.
5.3 Network:
No public/open Wi-Fi unless via enterprise VPN;
Tier 3: VPN mandatory; country/IP geo-restrictions may apply; no remote desktop sharing to unapproved endpoints.
5.4 Session Hygiene: Auto-logout after inactivity (≤ 15 min Tier 2, ≤ 10 min Tier 3).
6) Data Handling, Storage & DLP
6.1 Storage Locations: Confidential/Restricted data must reside only in Designated Systems.
6.2 Local Copies:
Tier 1: Local cache allowed if encrypted and essential; purge on exit.
Tier 2: Local copies discouraged; if essential, must be encrypted, short-lived, and tracked.
Tier 3: Local copies forbidden unless pre-approved, encrypted, and stored in an encrypted container with data-loss prevention (DLP) controls.
6.3 Printing/Export:
Tier 1: Print discouraged; watermark if printed.
Tier 2: Printing prohibited unless pre-approved; always watermarked.
Tier 3: Printing forbidden.
6.4 DLP & Watermarking: Do not remove/alter watermarks, disable copy/paste guards, or bypass download restrictions.
6.5 Personal Information: Apply safeguards relative to sensitivity; restrict access to need-to-know; avoid unnecessary retention.

6.6 PHI (if applicable): Encryption in transit/at rest; access logging; minimum necessary; breach handling per PHIPA.

7) Secrets & Keys
Use Designated Secrets Manager for all tokens, keys, passwords.
Never commit secrets to code, tickets, or chat.
Rotation:
Tier 1: at least quarterly;
Tier 2: at least monthly or on role change;
Tier 3: every 14–30 days and on any suspected exposure.
Service accounts must have scoped permissions and no human reuse.
8) AI/LLM & Automation Policy
Default: No uploading or deriving prompts from Confidential/Restricted data to external AI/LLM tools.
If Approved in §3: Provider must contractually (i) prohibit training on our data, (ii) ensure confidentiality, (iii) disable cross-tenant reuse, (iv) support deletion and data export, and (v) provide audit logs.
Tier 3 requires data residency and private/isolated inference (no multi-tenant training).
9) Open-Source & Third-Party Components
Declare all OSS components (name, version, license, repo).
Provide SBOM (SPDX/CycloneDX) for deliverables at acceptance.
No copyleft in proprietary deliverables without explicit written approval.
Run license/security scans; remediate high/critical issues before acceptance.
10) Deliverables, Packaging & Acceptance
Deliverables include source, build/run scripts, deployment notes, license notices, SBOM, and test evidence.
Acceptance criteria per the approved Offer/SOW.
Foreground IP transfer/licence per PPA; confirmatory assignment docs signed on request.
11) Incident Response & Breach Notice
Report within 24 hours: suspected loss, unauthorized access, malware, misdirected email/share, or credentials compromise.
Include scope, timeline, impacted systems/data, mitigations taken, and support needed.
Cooperate on containment, forensics, notification duties, and remediation.
Where personal information is involved, follow PIPEDA principles for safeguards and any breach-reporting obligations that apply; for PHI, follow PHIPA requirements.

12) Records, Monitoring & Audit
Participants consent to reasonable security monitoring and access logging within Designated Systems, used for compliance and dispute resolution.
Maintain activity records for work performed; do not delete audit logs.
AliceSolutions may conduct targeted audits (remote or onsite) with reasonable notice for Tier 2/3.
13) Conflicts, Subcontracting & Incompatible Work
Disclose conflicts of interest and relevant concurrent engagements.
No subcontracting without written approval; subcontractors must sign the Platform NDA and this Addendum before access.
Project Lead may reassign or limit scope to mitigate conflicts.
14) Cross-Border Transfers & Localization
Tier 2/3 data may not be transferred/stored outside Canada unless expressly permitted here: __________________________.
If cross-border is allowed, ensure equivalent protections and approved processors; data residency preferences must be honored.
15) Export Controls & Sanctions
Participants must comply with applicable export/sanctions laws; do not provide access to persons or regions under applicable sanctions. Notify AliceSolutions if screening raises a concern.
16) Community & Communications
No public disclosure, demos, or marketing of non-public project materials without written approval.
Respect CASL for any project-related commercial messages (consent, identification, unsubscribe).

17) Term, Suspension & Termination (Project-Specific)
This Addendum remains in force for the Project’s duration and survives per §18.
Access may be suspended immediately upon suspected breach, risk, or policy violation.
Termination of project participation does not relieve surviving obligations.
18) Return, Deletion & Exit Attestation
On request or exit, stop use; return or securely delete all Confidential Information (including derivatives) not held in Designated Systems.
Provide Attestation of Return/Deletion within 7 days.
Archival/legal copies may be retained where required by law, remaining confidential and inaccessible for any other use.
Duties of confidentiality/non-exfiltration survive for the period stated in the Platform NDA (typically 5 years from last access, or longer where trade secrets persist).

19) Remedies
Breaches of confidentiality, non-exfiltration, or data handling controls may cause irreparable harm. AliceSolutions and Disclosers may seek injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.
