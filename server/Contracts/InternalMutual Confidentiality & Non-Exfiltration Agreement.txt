Mutual Confidentiality & Non-Exfiltration Agreement
(Internal—AliceSolutions Ventures & Participants)
Effective Date: The date the first Participant (as defined below) signs this Agreement electronically or physically.
Parties:
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. (“AliceSolutions”); and
Each individual or entity that executes this Agreement (each a “Participant”, and collectively with AliceSolutions, the “Parties”).
Each Participant becomes a Party upon signature (including e-signature) and is bound with respect to every other Party.
1. Purpose
The Parties wish to explore, evaluate, build, or contribute to ventures and projects within the AliceSolutions ecosystem (the “Purpose”). In doing so, the Parties may disclose or access Confidential Information (defined below). This Agreement sets the rules for using, protecting, and returning that information and prohibits exfiltration or misuse.
2. Key Definitions
2.1 “Confidential Information” means any non-public information disclosed or made accessible, directly or indirectly, by one Party (“Discloser”) to another Party (“Recipient”), in any form (oral, written, visual, electronic, tangible), including without limitation:
technical data, source code, repositories, designs, product plans, roadmaps, business strategies, pricing, P&L and financials, customer lists, marketing plans, operating procedures, security architecture, access credentials, logs, and any materials labelled or reasonably understood as confidential;
information made available through Designated Systems (defined below), even if not expressly marked; and
personal information (as defined under applicable privacy laws) contained in or accompanying the above.
2.2 Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that the Recipient can demonstrate by contemporaneous records:
(a) is or becomes public through no breach by the Recipient;
(b) was known to the Recipient without confidentiality obligations before disclosure;
(c) is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information; or
(d) is rightfully received from a third party without confidentiality obligations.
2.3 “Designated Systems.” The systems, tools, and storage locations explicitly approved by AliceSolutions or the Project Lead for hosting, accessing, or processing Confidential Information (e.g., approved repositories, ticketing/work hubs, document vaults). Designated Systems will be listed in the relevant project space or provisioning notice.
2.4 “Project Lead.” The Party or individual designated by AliceSolutions to administer a project, approve contributors, issue per-project NDA addenda, and manage provisioning.
3. Non-Disclosure, Non-Use & Need-to-Know
3.1 Non-Disclosure. Recipient must not disclose any Confidential Information to anyone except its own personnel and subcontractors who (i) have a strict need-to-know for the Purpose, and (ii) are bound by written obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Recipient remains responsible for their compliance.
3.2 Non-Use. Recipient must use Confidential Information solely for the Purpose and not for any other purpose (including personal use, competition, or development outside the AliceSolutions ecosystem).
3.3 Care. Recipient must protect Confidential Information with no less than reasonable care and, for personal information, with safeguards appropriate to its sensitivity.
4. Non-Exfiltration (Security & Handling Rules)
4.1 Approved Environments Only. Recipient will access, process, store, transmit, and collaborate on Confidential Information only through Designated Systems.
Prohibited without prior written approval: copying to personal/email accounts, consumer cloud drives, portable media, local unencrypted storage, unmanaged devices, or third-party AI/LLM tools.
4.2 Technical Controls. Recipient will:
(a) maintain MFA on all accounts accessing Designated Systems;
(b) keep operating systems and security patches current;
(c) use device encryption on endpoints that cache or access Confidential Information;
(d) comply with DLP, watermarking, and access-logging controls enabled by AliceSolutions or the Project Lead.
4.3 AI/LLM & Automation. No uploading of Confidential Information (including prompts derived from it) to external AI/LLM or automation services unless the service is expressly approved as a Designated System and bound by terms that (i) prohibit training on the data, and (ii) ensure confidentiality and deletion on demand.
4.4 Minimum Necessary. Recipient must only download or replicate Confidential Information when essential for the Purpose and where the Designated Systems do not provide adequate online functionality.
4.5 Incident Notice. Suspected or actual loss, theft, unauthorized access, or disclosure must be reported to AliceSolutions immediately (within 24 hours) with all known details and mitigations.
5. Per-Project NDA Addenda
5.1 Just-in-Time Addenda. For specific projects, AliceSolutions or the Project Lead may issue Per-Project NDA Addenda (each an “Addendum”) that tailor scope, data classifications, permitted tools, deliverable handling, and additional controls. Addenda become part of this Agreement for that project upon signature.
5.2 Conflicts. If an Addendum conflicts with this Agreement, the Addendum prevails for that project.
6. Compelled Disclosures
If Recipient is legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information (e.g., subpoena, court or regulatory order), Recipient will (to the extent lawful) promptly notify Discloser to seek a protective order, disclose only what is legally required, and preserve confidentiality markings.
7. Personal Information & Compliance
7.1 Privacy Laws. Each Party will comply with applicable Canadian privacy law (including PIPEDA for commercial activities) and any provincial privacy law that applies to the project.
7.2 Safeguards. Recipient will implement physical, organizational, and technological safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information involved.
7.3 Transfers & Subprocessors. Recipient may not transfer personal information outside Canada or engage subprocessors to process it unless permitted by the applicable Addendum and only where equivalent protections apply.
8. Ownership; No License; Feedback
8.1 No License. Except for the limited Purpose, no rights or licenses (by implication or otherwise) to Confidential Information or IP are granted.
8.2 Feedback. If Recipient provides suggestions or feedback to any Party, the receiving Party may use them without obligation; no confidential treatment is required for feedback unless expressly agreed in writing.
9. Return, Deletion, and Retention
9.1 On Request or Exit. Upon the earlier of Discloser’s written request, project completion, or termination/exit, Recipient will promptly (a) stop using Confidential Information; (b) return or securely destroy it (including derived files), except for:
(i) archival copies required by law or internal compliance (which remain confidential), and
(ii) standard backups not readily accessible (which Recipient will not restore except for legal or disaster recovery needs).
9.2 Attestation. Recipient will certify completion of return/deletion upon request.
10. Term; Survival
10.1 Term. This Agreement begins on the Effective Date for each Participant and continues until terminated as to that Participant on 10 days’ written notice to AliceSolutions.
10.2 Survival Period. Recipient’s duties under Sections 3–9 and 11–14 survive for five (5) years from the Recipient’s last access to the relevant Confidential Information; trade secrets survive as long as they remain trade secrets; personal information protections survive as required by law.
11. Non-Solicitation & Non-Circumvention (Internal)
11.1 Non-Solicitation (12 Months). For twelve (12) months after a project ends or a Participant’s exit (whichever is later), Recipient will not, without prior written consent of the employing Party:
(a) actively solicit for employment or engagement any employee or core contractor of another Party who directly worked with Recipient on a project; or
(b) induce any customer or partner of an AliceSolutions venture encountered through the project to terminate or materially reduce business with that venture.
(This clause does not prohibit general advertising not targeted at such persons.)
11.2 Non-Circumvention (12 Months). For twelve (12) months after project end/exit, Recipient will not circumvent AliceSolutions or the Project Lead to engage directly with a venture, customer, or supplier introduced solely through project Confidential Information in a manner intended to avoid the platform or revenue sharing in effect for that project.
11.3 No Non-Compete for Employees. Nothing in this Agreement is a non-compete for employees where prohibited by applicable law.
12. Remedies; Injunctive Relief
Recipient acknowledges that breach of Sections 3–5, 7, 9, or 11 may cause irreparable harm not adequately compensable by damages. Discloser is entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief (including specific performance) in addition to other remedies.
13. Warranties & Disclaimers
Confidential Information is provided “as is.” Discloser makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding accuracy, completeness, merchantability, fitness, or non-infringement.
14. E-Signature; Counterparts
The Parties agree this Agreement and any Addenda may be executed and delivered by electronic signature and will have the same legal effect as wet ink signatures. Counterparts and exchanged copies (including PDFs) together form one instrument.
15. General
15.1 Governing Law & Forum. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. The Parties submit to the courts of Toronto, Ontario (exclusive jurisdiction).
15.2 No Assignment. Recipient may not assign this Agreement without AliceSolutions’ prior written consent, except to an affiliate or successor in a merger/acquisition that assumes all obligations herein.
15.3 Order of Precedence. If there is a conflict, a signed Per-Project Addendum controls for that project; otherwise, this Agreement controls over any conflicting click-through or policy.
15.4 Notices. Formal notices must be sent by email with confirmation or by courier to the addresses on file in the platform account or as later updated in writing.
15.5 Severability. If any provision is invalid or unenforceable, it will be narrowed and enforced to the maximum extent permissible; the remainder stays in effect.
15.6 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement (together with any Addenda) is the Parties’ entire confidentiality and non-exfiltration agreement for the Purpose and supersedes prior NDAs between the same Parties for the same Purpose. Amendments must be in a writing signed (including e-signature) by the Parties.
