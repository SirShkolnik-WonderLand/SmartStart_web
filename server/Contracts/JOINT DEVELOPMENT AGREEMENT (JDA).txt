JOINT DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (JDA)
(AliceSolutions Hub – Venture/Project Co-Creation)
Version: 1.0

1. PARTIES; EFFECTIVE DATE
   This Joint Development Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the date of the last signature below (“Effective Date”) by and between the undersigned parties listed on the signature pages (each a “Party,” collectively, the “Parties”). If a signatory signs on behalf of a company, they represent they have authority to bind that company.

2. RELATIONSHIP TO PLATFORM DOCUMENTS; ORDER OF PRECEDENCE
   2.1 Platform Stack. This Agreement supplements the Hub’s **Platform Participation Agreement (PPA)**, **Mutual NDA (Internal)**, and any **Per-Project NDA Addendum** (together, the “Platform Legal Pack”). Capitalized terms used here follow the Platform Legal Pack where applicable.
   2.2 Precedence (Project-specific). For the Project identified below: **Per-Project NDA Addendum → Mutual NDA → this JDA → PPA → published Hub policies**.
   2.3 No Employment/Partnership. Nothing here creates an employment, partnership, or agency relationship; each Party remains independent.

3. PROJECT; PURPOSE
   3.1 Project. The Parties agree to jointly research, design, develop, test, and integrate the technologies, deliverables, and documentation described in **Schedule A (Development Plan)** (the “Project”).
   3.2 Purpose. Create new technology and/or product features and evaluate commercialization paths through the Hub (the “Purpose”).

4. DEFINITIONS
   “Background IP” means any IP owned or controlled by a Party prior to the Effective Date or developed independently outside the Project without use of Confidential Information of another Party.
   “Foreground IP” means all IP in inventions, works, code, data models, designs, results, and documentation first conceived, created, or reduced to practice in the performance of the Project.
   “Joint Technology” means Foreground IP contributed to by two or more Parties such that inventorship or authorship is shared.
   “Deliverables” means the tangible outputs defined in Schedule A and any updates, documentation, test evidence, SBOMs, and deployment artifacts.
   “Designated Systems” means the approved repos, doc vaults, ticketing, CI/CD, secrets manager, and storage locations listed in Schedule D.

5. GOVERNANCE & MANAGEMENT
   5.1 Management Committee. The Parties establish a **Management Committee** (“MC”) consisting of one voting representative from each Party (names in Schedule C). The MC sets cadence, approves Major Changes (scope, budget, timeline, access elevation), and resolves priority conflicts.
   5.2 Workstream Lead(s). Each Party names a Workstream Lead responsible for day-to-day execution and reporting to the MC.
   5.3 Decisions. Routine technical decisions are made by Workstream Leads. **Major Changes** require written MC approval. Deadlocks escalate to mediation per §18.
   5.4 Records. Each Party maintains accurate time, cost, and work logs; all substantive decisions are minuted and stored in Designated Systems.

6. SECURITY; HANDLING; NON-EXFILTRATION
   6.1 Platform Controls. The Parties shall use **Designated Systems only** and comply with the security, DLP, and non-exfiltration rules in the Platform Legal Pack and the Per-Project NDA Addendum.
   6.2 Devices & Identity. MFA on all accounts; encrypted devices; timely patching. Where the Project is Tier 3 (Highly Restricted), managed devices, VPN, and hardware security keys are required.
   6.3 Incidents. Suspected or actual unauthorized access/disclosure must be reported in the Hub’s security channel **within 24 hours** with details and mitigations.
   6.4 No External LLMs. No uploads or derived prompts to external AI/LLM tools unless expressly approved in the Per-Project Addendum and bound by no-training/no-reuse terms.

7. DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS
   7.1 Performance. Each Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete its tasks in Schedule A and meet milestones, quality bars, and acceptance tests.
   7.2 Contribution Logging. Commits, PRs, design docs, tickets, and reviews are logged in Designated Systems and tagged to the relevant Deliverables.
   7.3 Acceptance. Deliverables are accepted when (i) explicitly approved by the designated reviewer in Schedule A; or (ii) no specific, test-based rejection is issued within **5 business days** of submission.

8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY – OWNERSHIP MODELS (SELECT IN SCHEDULE B)
   The Parties MUST select one IP model in **Schedule B**. If none is selected, **Model A** applies by default.

**MODEL A – ASSIGNMENT TO VENTURE/NEWCO (RECOMMENDED)**
8A.1 Assignment. All Foreground IP (including Joint Technology) is **assigned** on acceptance to the **Venture/NewCo** identified in Schedule B (or, if not yet formed, to the Party designated as holder on trust for NewCo).
8A.2 Background License. Each Party grants the Venture/NewCo a **non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable license** (with right to sublicense) to its Background IP solely as necessary to use, maintain, and commercialize the Foreground IP and Deliverables.
8A.3 License-Back. Venture/NewCo grants each contributing Party a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use contributed portions internally for portfolio demonstrations and self-marketing, excluding source release unless otherwise agreed.
8A.4 Confirmatory Documents. Each Party will execute further documents to perfect assignment, record title, and support prosecution/enforcement.

**MODEL B – JOINT OWNERSHIP WITH CROSS-LICENSES**
8B.1 Joint Ownership. Foreground IP authored/invented jointly is **jointly owned** by the contributing Parties, each with an undivided interest, subject to the licenses below. Foreground IP authored solely is owned by the creating Party, subject to licenses below.
8B.2 Cross-Licenses. Each owner grants the other Parties (and the Venture if listed in Schedule B) a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, reproduce, modify, make, have made, and commercialize the Foreground IP within the **Field of Use** defined in Schedule B.
8B.3 Coordination. The Parties will adopt a single product roadmap and branding for jointly owned outputs to avoid market confusion. No Party may assert the jointly owned Foreground IP against another Party or the Venture.
8B.4 Buy-Out Option (Optional). Any Party may trigger a good-faith negotiation to acquire the other Parties’ undivided interests on terms in Schedule B. Failing agreement, a neutral valuation expert process in §18 applies.

**COMMON TERMS (APPLY TO BOTH MODELS)**
8C.1 Background IP. Except as licensed herein, each Party retains all right, title, and interest in its Background IP. A **Background IP Schedule** (Schedule E) lists any components subject to third-party constraints.
8C.2 Improvements. Improvements to a Party’s Background IP made during the Project are that Party’s property unless the improvement is separable Foreground IP under the chosen model.
8C.3 Moral Rights. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Party’s contributors **waive** and/or agree not to assert moral rights in Foreground IP and Deliverables against the other Parties, the Venture/NewCo, and their successors.
8C.4 OSS & Third-Party Components. Each Party must declare OSS (name, version, license, repo), ensure license compatibility, and deliver an **SBOM** with each Deliverable. No copyleft licenses in proprietary Deliverables without prior written approval.

9. PATENTS; FILING; COSTS (POLICY – COMPLETE IN SCHEDULE F)
   9.1 Filing Strategy. The MC will decide whether, where, and how to file patent applications for Foreground IP.
   9.2 Prosecution & Costs. Prosecution responsibility and cost sharing will follow **Schedule F (IP Filing & Prosecution Policy)**. If a Party declines to share costs, it may assign its interest for nominal consideration or grant an exclusive field-limited license to the paying Party(ies).
   9.3 Notices. Each Party promptly discloses patentable inventions with enabling detail through the Hub for docketing.

10. COMMERCIALIZATION; BRAND; FIELD OF USE
    10.1 Commercialization Plan. The Parties will follow the commercialization plan in **Schedule G**, including target markets, timelines, and compliance requirements.
    10.2 Brand. Use of names, logos, and trademarks follows **Schedule G** and the PPA’s publicity rules.
    10.3 Field of Use (Model B only). The Field of Use and any exclusivities appear in Schedule B.

11. DATA PROTECTION; PERSONAL/HEALTH DATA
    11.1 Minimization. Avoid personal information unless necessary; if required, apply safeguards appropriate to sensitivity under applicable Canadian privacy laws.
    11.2 DPA/DSA. If personal information will be processed between Parties, a **Data Processing/Sharing Addendum** (Controller–Processor or Controller–Controller) is attached as **Schedule H** and governs roles, safeguards, breach notice, retention, and cross-border transfers.
    11.3 PHI. If PHI is involved, apply sectoral rules and the stricter controls in the Per-Project NDA Addendum.

12. FEES; COST SHARING
    12.1 Project Costs. Unless otherwise specified in **Schedule I (Budget & Cost Sharing)**, each Party bears its own internal costs. Shared external costs (e.g., security tests, hosting) are split as in Schedule I.
    12.2 Rewards. Cash, tokens (**BUZ**), equity, or other consideration, if any, are stated in Schedule I or in separate SOWs referenced therein.

13. WARRANTIES
    Each Party represents and warrants that: (i) it has the rights to grant the licenses and assignments herein; (ii) its Deliverables are original to it, free of known malicious code, and do not knowingly infringe third-party rights; (iii) it will comply with the Platform Legal Pack, the Per-Project Addendum, and this Agreement.

14. INDEMNITIES
    14.1 IP Indemnity. Each Party will defend and indemnify the others (and the Venture/NewCo) against third-party claims alleging that its Deliverables, as provided, infringe Canadian IP rights, excluding claims arising from (a) combinations not supplied by the indemnifying Party, (b) third-party components declared and used per license, or (c) modifications by others.
    14.2 Data/Security Indemnity. Each Party will defend and indemnify the others for losses arising from that Party’s breach of §6 or §11.
    14.3 Procedure. Prompt notice, control of defence by indemnifying Party, cooperation by the other Parties, and no settlements that impose non-monetary obligations without consent.

15. LIABILITY LIMITS
    15.1 No Indirects. No Party is liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
    15.2 Cap. Except for **Excluded Matters**, each Party’s aggregate liability to all others under this Agreement is capped at the greater of **(a) CAD \$50,000; or (b) the total value of that Party’s Project-specific rewards and cost-share commitments in the prior 12 months**.
    15.3 Excluded Matters. The cap does not apply to: (i) breach of confidentiality, security, or non-exfiltration; (ii) IP infringement indemnity; (iii) data/PHI breach indemnity; or (iv) fraud or wilful misconduct.

16. PUBLICITY; PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
    No Party may publish or disclose non-public Project information without MC approval and subject to the NDA. Branding and announcements follow Schedule G and PPA rules.

17. TERM; TERMINATION; EXIT
    17.1 Term. This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues until the earlier of (i) Project completion; or (ii) termination under this Section.
    17.2 Convenience Exit. A Party may withdraw on **20 days’ written notice**; obligations to complete in-progress, accepted milestones survive unless the MC agrees otherwise.
    17.3 For-Cause Termination. Immediate termination for material breach not cured within **10 business days** of notice, or immediately for security/confidentiality risk.
    17.4 Exit Duties. On exit/termination, the exiting Party will (a) cease use; (b) return or securely delete Confidential Information not in Designated Systems; (c) deliver all in-progress artifacts and build/run docs; (d) transfer access it controls; and (e) execute confirmatory IP assignments or licenses per the chosen model.
    17.5 Survival. §§6, 8–16, 17.4, 18–20 survive.

18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
    18.1 Internal Escalation. Workstream Leads → MC.
    18.2 Mediation. If unresolved within **15 days** after MC escalation, the Parties will attempt good-faith **mediation** (Toronto; virtual acceptable).
    18.3 Injunctive Relief. A Party may seek urgent injunctive relief for breaches of confidentiality/security/IP.
    18.4 Forum. If still unresolved, claims may be brought in the **courts of Toronto, Ontario** (exclusive jurisdiction).

19. E-SIGNATURES; COUNTERPARTS; NOTICES
    Electronic signatures/records are binding; counterparts permitted. Notices via the Hub notice mechanism or email with confirmation per Schedule C.

20. GENERAL
    20.1 Assignment. No assignment without written consent, except to an affiliate or successor that assumes all obligations.
    20.2 Severability. Invalid terms will be enforced to the maximum lawful extent; the remainder stays in effect.
    20.3 Entire Agreement. This JDA (with Schedules) is the entire agreement among the Parties regarding joint development for this Project and supersedes prior joint-dev terms for the same scope.
