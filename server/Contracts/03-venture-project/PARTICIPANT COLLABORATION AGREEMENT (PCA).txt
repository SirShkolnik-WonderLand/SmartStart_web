PARTICIPANT COLLABORATION AGREEMENT (PCA)
(AliceSolutions Hub – Inter-Participant Workstream)
Version: 1.0

1. PARTIES; EFFECTIVE DATE
   This Participant Collaboration Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the date of the last signature below (“Effective Date”) by and between the undersigned participants to the workstream identified in Schedule A (each, a “Participant,” collectively, the “Participants”). If a signatory signs for a company, they represent they have authority to bind that company; “Participant” then means that company.

2. RELATIONSHIP TO PLATFORM DOCUMENTS; THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY
   2.1 Platform Stack. This Agreement supplements (and does not replace) the Hub’s **Platform Participation Agreement (PPA)**, **Mutual NDA**, and any **Per-Project NDA Addendum** (collectively, the “Platform Legal Pack”). Capitalized terms used here follow the Platform Legal Pack where applicable.
   2.2 Precedence. For this workstream: **Per-Project NDA Addendum → Mutual NDA → this PCA → PPA → published Hub policies**.
   2.3 Third-Party Beneficiary. **AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. (“AliceSolutions”)** is an intended third-party beneficiary solely to enforce Sections 5 (Security & Non-Exfiltration), 8 (IP), 9 (Data Protection), 12 (Exit), and 16 (Remedies) to protect the platform and ventures.

3. PURPOSE; SCOPE
   3.1 Purpose. The Participants wish to collaborate on the workstream described in **Schedule A (Scope & Deliverables)** within the AliceSolutions Hub (the “Workstream”).
   3.2 No Employment. Nothing here creates an employment, partnership, or joint venture between Participants; each remains independent.

4. GOVERNANCE & DECISION RIGHTS
   4.1 Roles. The Workstream will have a **Workstream Lead** (named in Schedule A) who manages day-to-day coordination, backlog triage, and acceptance reviews.
   4.2 Major Decisions. Changes to Scope, Deliverable definitions, release gates, or access elevation are “Major Decisions” and require **written consent of all Participants affected**.
   4.3 Deadlock. Unresolved disputes escalate in order: (i) Workstream Lead mediation; (ii) **Project Lead** (as defined by the Hub) for a binding tie-break; (iii) dispute process in Section 15.

5. SECURITY, TOOLING & NON-EXFILTRATION
   5.1 Designated Systems Only. Participants will access, store, and process Workstream materials **only** in the **Designated Systems** listed in **Schedule D** (repos, doc vaults, tickets, CI/CD, secrets manager).
   5.2 Device/Network. MFA on all accounts; encrypted devices; timely OS/patching. For Highly Restricted tiers (if applicable), managed devices, VPN, and hardware keys may be required as set by the Per-Project NDA Addendum.
   5.3 DLP/Controls. Do not remove watermarks, defeat copy/export guards, or move materials to personal clouds or unapproved tools.
   5.4 Incidents. Suspected unauthorized access/disclosure must be reported in the Hub’s security channel **within 24 hours** with known details and mitigations.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS; LOGGING; CHANGE CONTROL
   6.1 Contribution Logs. Each Participant will log work through the Hub (commits/PRs/tickets/docs), tagging the Deliverable and reference issue.
   6.2 Acceptance. The Workstream Lead will review Deliverables within **5 business days**; acceptance occurs when (a) explicitly approved; or (b) no written, specific rejection is issued within the window. Rejections must cite objective criteria in Schedule A.
   6.3 Changes. **Change Requests (CRs)** must include scope deltas, effort, timeline, and impact on splits; proposed acceptance tests; and security impact. The Workstream Lead circulates CRs; affected Participants respond within **3 business days**.

7. FEES, REWARDS & EXPENSES
   7.1 Splits. Monetary fees, **BUZ** tokens, equity or other rewards are allocated per **Schedule B (Rewards & Splits)**. Unless Schedule B states otherwise, splits apply to **accepted** Deliverables only.
   7.2 Invoicing/Payments. If any Participant pays another, invoicing and payment terms are in Schedule B; the payer may **set off** legitimate, documented amounts owed by the payee.
   7.3 Expenses. Pre-approved, receipted expenses are reimbursable per Schedule B; non-approved expenses are at the spender’s risk.
   7.4 Taxes. Each Participant is responsible for its own taxes and withholdings.

8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; OSS
   8.1 Background IP. Each Participant retains its pre-existing IP. To the extent required for the Workstream, each grants the other Participants and the venture a **non-exclusive, royalty-free license** to its Background IP solely to use and exploit the Foreground IP and Deliverables, without sublicensing beyond the venture unless stated in Schedule B or the PPA.
   8.2 Foreground IP. Unless a different allocation is set in **Schedule B** or the PPA/SOW, **Foreground IP in Deliverables is assigned to the venture/project owner** upon acceptance and settlement of the agreed reward; where assignment isn’t permitted, an irrevocable, exclusive, transferable license is granted instead.
   8.3 Moral Rights. To the maximum extent permitted, Participants **waive** and/or agree not to enforce moral rights in accepted Deliverables against the venture, AliceSolutions, and their successors.
   8.4 Open-Source. Participants will (i) declare all OSS used (name, version, license, repo), (ii) avoid copyleft in proprietary Deliverables unless pre-approved in writing, and (iii) deliver an **SBOM** on acceptance.

9. DATA PROTECTION; PERSONAL/HEALTH DATA
   9.1 Minimization. Avoid including personal information in Workstream data unless necessary.
   9.2 Compliance. If personal information is handled, Participants will apply safeguards appropriate to sensitivity under applicable Canadian privacy laws and any sectoral law (e.g., PHIPA for PHI). A **Data Sharing or Processing Addendum** may be required; if so, it becomes **Schedule B-DPA** and binds Participants.

10. WARRANTIES
    Each Participant represents and warrants that: (i) it has the rights to grant the licenses/assignments herein; (ii) Deliverables are original, free of known malicious code, and do not knowingly infringe third-party rights; (iii) it will follow the security/tooling rules in Section 5 and the Per-Project NDA Addendum.

11. LIABILITY LIMITS (BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS)
    11.1 Cap. Except for Excluded Matters, each Participant’s **aggregate** liability to the others under this Agreement will not exceed the greater of **(a) CAD \$10,000; or (b) the total value of that Participant’s last 6 months of Workstream rewards**.
    11.2 No Indirects. No party is liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
    11.3 Excluded Matters. The above limits don’t apply to: (i) breach of confidentiality/non-exfiltration/security obligations; (ii) IP infringement or breach of OSS obligations; (iii) a party’s fraud or wilful misconduct.

12. EXIT; HANDOVER; SURVIVAL
    12.1 Convenience Exit. A Participant may exit on **10 days’ written notice**.
    12.2 For-Cause Termination. Immediate termination for material breach not cured within **5 business days** after notice, or immediately if the breach risks security/confidentiality.
    12.3 Handover. On exit or termination, the exiting Participant will (i) return or securely delete Confidential Information not in Designated Systems; (ii) deliver all in-progress artifacts and reasonable build/run docs; (iii) transfer any access it controls; and (iv) sign reasonable confirmatory IP assignments if due.
    12.4 Survival. Sections 5, 8–11, 12.3–12.4, 13, 15–17 survive.

13. NON-SOLICIT; NON-CIRCUMVENT (LIMITED)
    For **12 months** after the later of Workstream completion or a Participant’s exit, Participants will not: (i) directly solicit for employment the other’s personnel who materially worked on this Workstream (general ads excluded); (ii) circumvent the venture/AliceSolutions to engage with a customer or supplier introduced solely through this Workstream to **avoid** platform revenue sharing in force for this project.

14. SUBCONTRACTING; CONFLICTS
    14.1 No Subcontracting without prior written approval; subcontractors must sign the Platform Legal Pack and this PCA before access.
    14.2 Conflicts of Interest must be disclosed in **Schedule F** and updated promptly.

15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
    15.1 Internal Escalation. Team-level discussion → Workstream Lead → Project Lead.
    15.2 Mediation. If unresolved, the Participants will attempt good-faith **mediation** within **15 days** of a written request (Toronto, virtual acceptable).
    15.3 Forum. If still unresolved, claims may be brought in the **courts of Toronto, Ontario** (exclusive jurisdiction). Nothing limits urgent injunctive relief.

16. REMEDIES; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
    Breaches of confidentiality, security, non-exfiltration, or IP provisions may cause irreparable harm; the non-breaching party and/or AliceSolutions may seek **injunctive** and other equitable relief in addition to damages.

17. GENERAL
    17.1 Notices. Via the Hub notice mechanism or email with confirmation, per the addresses in Schedule A (updated by notice).
    17.2 Assignment. No assignment without written consent, except to an affiliate or successor that assumes all obligations.
    17.3 E-Signatures. Electronic signatures/records are binding; counterparts permitted.
    17.4 Entire Agreement. This PCA (with Schedules) is the entire agreement among Participants regarding the Workstream and supersedes prior inter-participant terms for this Workstream.
    17.5 Severability. Invalid terms will be enforced to the maximum lawful extent; the remainder stays in effect.
