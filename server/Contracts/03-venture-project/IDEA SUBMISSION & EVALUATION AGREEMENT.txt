IDEA SUBMISSION & EVALUATION AGREEMENT
(AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. – “Evaluation Agreement”)
Version: 1.0

1. PARTIES; EFFECTIVE DATE
   This Evaluation Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the date of the last signature below (“Effective Date”) by and between:
   (a) AliceSolutions Ventures Inc., an Ontario corporation (“AliceSolutions”); and
   (b) The individual or entity identified on the signature page (“Submitter”).

If an individual signs on behalf of a company, they represent they have authority to bind that company; “Submitter” then means that company.

2. PURPOSE; NO OBLIGATION
   2.1 Purpose. Submitter wishes to disclose certain information, materials, concepts, artifacts, and data about a business or product idea (collectively, “Submission Materials”) to AliceSolutions solely so that AliceSolutions may evaluate whether to incubate, invest in, collaborate on, or otherwise engage with the idea (the “Purpose”).
   2.2 No Obligation. AliceSolutions has no obligation to (i) proceed with any transaction; (ii) use, develop, or commercialize the idea; (iii) provide feedback; or (iv) compensate Submitter unless and until the parties sign a separate written agreement (e.g., Studio/Incubation Agreement, MSA/SOW, Equity Agreement).
   2.3 No Partnership. This Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, or agency.

3. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS
   3.1 Platform Terms. If the parties have executed (or the Submitter has accepted) the AliceSolutions Platform Participation Agreement and/or Mutual NDA (“Platform Legal Pack”), those documents govern generally; this Agreement supplements them for the Purpose. In case of conflict regarding confidentiality, a signed Mutual NDA controls; otherwise, this Agreement governs confidentiality for the Submission Materials.
   3.2 No Assignment of IP. This Agreement does not assign any intellectual property (“IP”) in the Submission Materials or in AliceSolutions’ background or independent developments.

4. DEFINITIONS
   “Confidential Information” means non-public Submission Materials that Submitter marks as confidential or that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure (including, without limitation, product concepts, business plans, customer data, financials, source code, designs, security architectures, and personal information). Confidential Information excludes information that AliceSolutions can demonstrate by contemporaneous records (i) is or becomes public without breach; (ii) was known without duty of confidentiality before receipt; (iii) is independently developed without use of the Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully received from a third party without confidentiality obligations.

5. SUBMISSION & HYGIENE
   5.1 Channel. Submitter will provide Submission Materials only via the Hub’s designated upload, repository, or intake workflow (“Designated Systems”).
   5.2 Labelling. Submitter will clearly mark confidential materials and, where feasible, provide succinct written summaries to enable triage without broad disclosure.
   5.3 Safety. Submitter will not include malware, unlawful content, third-party personal data without authority, or materials restricted by law, export controls, or contract. Submitter will not include secrets subject to obligations that would prevent evaluation.

6. CONFIDENTIALITY; HANDLING; RETURN
   6.1 Use & Care. AliceSolutions will (i) use Confidential Information solely for the Purpose; (ii) not disclose it beyond personnel and professional advisors with a need-to-know who are bound by duties at least as protective; and (iii) protect it with no less than reasonable care and with safeguards appropriate to sensitivity (including for personal information).
   6.2 Designated Systems. Except where necessary for the Purpose, AliceSolutions will store Confidential Information only in Designated Systems and apply reasonable access controls, audit logging, and (where applicable) encryption.
   6.3 Compelled Disclosure. If legally compelled to disclose, AliceSolutions may do so after providing prompt notice (where lawful) and disclosing only what is legally required.
   6.4 Return/Deletion. Upon Submitter’s written request or after the evaluation concludes, AliceSolutions will cease use and, at Submitter’s option, return or securely delete Confidential Information not held in standard immutable backups or legal archives (which remain protected and are not accessed except for compliance). On request, AliceSolutions will provide a brief deletion/return attestation.
   6.5 Survival. Duties in this Section 6 survive for five (5) years from the Effective Date; trade secrets survive as long as they remain trade secrets.

7. LIMITED LICENSE TO EVALUATE (NO COMMERCIAL USE)
   7.1 Evaluation License. Submitter grants AliceSolutions a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use the Submission Materials solely to evaluate the idea internally for the Purpose, including making limited copies and derivative works necessary for evaluation (e.g., analysis notes, mockups). No commercial exploitation is permitted absent a subsequent written agreement.
   7.2 Feedback. If AliceSolutions provides feedback or suggestions to Submitter, Submitter may use them without restriction; feedback is not Confidential Information unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.

8. INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT; SAFE HARBOR
   8.1 Independent Development. AliceSolutions may currently be developing, or in the future may develop, acquire, or receive from others, products, services, concepts, or ideas that are similar to or competitive with the Submission Materials. Nothing in this Agreement limits AliceSolutions’ right to do so, provided AliceSolutions does not breach Section 6 (Confidentiality) in doing so.
   8.2 Residuals (Optional). AliceSolutions may use information retained in the unaided memory of individuals who have had access to the Submission Materials (“Residuals”) for the purpose of product development and marketing, provided such use does not involve disclosure of Submitter’s Confidential Information in tangible form and does not violate Section 6. If Submitter does not agree, strike this Section 8.2 before signature.

9. OWNERSHIP; REPRESENTATIONS; OSS & THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS
   9.1 Ownership. Except for the Evaluation License, Submitter retains all right, title, and interest in the Submission Materials; AliceSolutions retains all right, title, and interest in its background IP, platforms, tools, and independent developments.
   9.2 Representations. Submitter represents and warrants that: (i) it owns or controls the Submission Materials and has authority to grant the rights herein; (ii) the Submission Materials do not knowingly infringe third-party rights; (iii) to the extent the Submission Materials include third-party components (including open-source software), their licenses are compatible with the Purpose and have been properly identified; and (iv) disclosure to AliceSolutions complies with applicable law, privacy, and contractual obligations.
   9.3 Indemnity. Submitter will defend and indemnify AliceSolutions against third-party claims arising from breach of Section 9.2, subject to prompt notice and reasonable cooperation.

10. PRIVACY; PERSONAL INFORMATION
    If the Submission Materials contain personal information, each party will comply with applicable Canadian privacy laws (including PIPEDA, and any applicable provincial laws) and implement safeguards appropriate to sensitivity. The parties will avoid unnecessary personal data in evaluation, minimize access to need-to-know, and promptly notify the other party of any suspected unauthorized access or disclosure.

11. NO WARRANTY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    11.1 “AS IS.” THE SUBMISSION MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” ALICESOLUTIONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBMISSION MATERIALS OR THE EVALUATION, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ACCURACY.
    11.2 Liability Cap. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND CANADIAN DOLLARS (CAD \$1,000). THE FOREGOING LIMITS DO NOT APPLY TO (A) A PARTY’S BREACH OF SECTION 6 (CONFIDENTIALITY) OR SECTION 9.3 (INDEMNITY), OR (B) A PARTY’S FRAUD OR WILFUL MISCONDUCT, WHICH CANNOT BE LIMITED UNDER CANADIAN LAW.

12. TERM; TERMINATION
    12.1 Term. This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues until the earlier of (i) the parties executing a subsequent written agreement covering the idea; or (ii) thirty (30) days after either party provides written notice of termination.
    12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, the Evaluation License ends and Section 6.4 (Return/Deletion) applies. Sections 6, 8–11, 13–15 survive.

13. EQUITABLE RELIEF
    Breach of Section 6 (Confidentiality) may cause irreparable harm. The non-breaching party is entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to any other remedies.

14. GOVERNING LAW; FORUM
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflicts-of-law rules. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial or federal courts located in Toronto, Ontario.

15. E-SIGNATURES; COUNTERPARTS; NOTICES
    15.1 E-Signatures. The parties agree electronic signatures and records are legally binding and enforceable under the Ontario Electronic Commerce Act, 2000 (subject to statutory exceptions).
    15.2 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which together form one instrument. PDF and electronic copies are deemed originals.
    15.3 Notices. Notices under this Agreement must be sent by email with confirmation (or via the Hub’s notice mechanism) to the addresses on the signature page or updated in writing.

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; ORDER OF PRECEDENCE; SEVERABILITY
    This Agreement is the parties’ entire agreement regarding evaluation of the Submission Materials and supersedes prior NDAs covering the same Purpose unless expressly preserved. If both this Agreement and a Mutual NDA are in effect, the Mutual NDA governs confidentiality; this Agreement governs the evaluation license, independent development, and liability provisions. If any provision is found invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted and the remainder will continue in full force.
