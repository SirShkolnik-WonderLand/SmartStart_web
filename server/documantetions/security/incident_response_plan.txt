INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN (IRP)
AliceSolutions Ventures Inc. — Hub & Ventures
Version: 1.0 • Owner: CISO • Effective: on publication

0. PURPOSE & SCOPE
   Define the end-to-end process to prepare for, detect, triage, contain, eradicate, recover from, and learn from security/privacy incidents affecting the Hub, ventures, and all projects. Applies to all tiers (T0–T3); where controls differ, enforce the **highest tier involved**.

0.1 REFERENCES (internal)
• Security Controls Master (`security_controls_master.txt`)
• Logging & Monitoring Standard (`logging_monitoring_standard.txt`)
• Data Classification Standard (`data_classification_standard.txt`)
• BCP/DR Policy (`bcp_dr_policy.txt`)
• DPA & NDAs (for legal definitions & notice duties)

1. DEFINITIONS
   **Security Incident:** Any suspected or confirmed event that compromises confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems/data, or violates policy/law/contract.
   **Privacy Incident/Breach:** Loss, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of personal information (PI/PHI).
   **Major Incident:** Sev-1 or Sev-2 event (see §3) or any event with potential legal/contractual notification.
   **Forensically sound:** Actions that preserve evidence integrity and chain of custody.

2. ROLES & CONTACTS (RACI)
   • **Incident Commander (IC):** CISO (delegate: Security.Admin) — overall coordination (R)
   • **Security Operations (SecOps):** Security.Admin, SRE Lead — detection, triage, containment (R)
   • **Forensics Lead:** SRE Lead (delegate: senior SRE) — evidence capture, chain of custody (R)
   • **Comms Lead:** Org.Owner (delegate: Project Lead) — internal/external comms (A/R)
   • **Legal/Privacy:** Legal.Admin & DPO — legal strategy, breach law, regulator/client notices (A/R)
   • **Project Owner(s):** Impact assessment, service recovery (C/R)
   • **People Ops:** If insider involved; HR actions (C)
   • **All Staff:** Report within minutes; do not disclose externally (R to report, C otherwise)

**On-call:** Publish weekly; paging in on-call calendar. **Hotline:** teams\://Incident-Bridge (auto-created per event).

3. SEVERITY & SLAs
   **Sev-1 (Critical):** Active compromise of production/service-wide outage; confirmed exfiltration of T2/T3 data; ransomware; keys leak.
   → Page on-call immediately; IC within 5 min; Exec brief within 30 min; initial public holding line within 4 h (if needed).
   **Sev-2 (High):** Limited compromise; high-risk vuln actively exploited; PI exposure suspected but scope limited; major third-party outage affecting us.
   → Page on-call; IC within 15 min; Exec brief within 2 h.
   **Sev-3 (Medium):** Suspicious activity; contained malware; misconfig with no evidence of access; failed DLP attempts.
   → Triage within same business day.
   **Sev-4 (Low):** Benign alerts; policy deviations with no risk.
   → Triage within 2 business days.

**24-hour rule:** For any confirmed breach of safeguards involving PI/PHI, notify Legal/Privacy immediately; **regulatory/contractual clock starts on awareness**. Keep detailed timeline.

4. LIFECYCLE (PHASES)

4.1 PREPARE
• Train all staff (onboarding + annual).
• Run table-tops **semi-annually** (include third-party breach & ransomware).
• Ensure logging, alerting, backups, runbooks, contact lists, and legal counsel on retainer are current.
• Test restore paths quarterly (see BCP/DR).

4.2 DETECT & REPORT
**Triggers:** SIEM/alerts; DLP events; EDR detections; user reports; vendor notices; unusual billing; media tips.
**Report channel:** `#ir-<YYYYMMDD>-<shortname>` (auto-create) + incident ticket (`IR-####`).
**Do not:** Power off affected systems (unless instructed), delete logs, or contact attackers.

4.3 TRIAGE (10–30 min for Sev-1/2)
• Assign IC, Forensics Lead, Comms Lead.
• Confirm severity & scope: data tier, systems, accounts, indicators of compromise (IOCs).
• Decide go/no-go for **containment** actions; start evidence capture checklist (see §9).

4.4 CONTAINMENT
**Short-term:**
• Disable compromised accounts/keys; rotate secrets (per tier); block IOCs at IdP/EDR/network; snapshot affected VMs/containers.
**Long-term:**
• Patch, reconfigure, or isolate segments; create clean environments for recovery; disable risky integrations.
**Rule:** Prefer actions that **preserve evidence** while stopping active harm.

4.5 ERADICATION
• Remove malware; revoke/rotate credentials; wipe/rebuild compromised nodes from gold images; validate no persistence.
• Confirm vulnerabilities closed and compensating controls in place.

4.6 RECOVERY
• Restore from known-good backups; validate integrity; gradual traffic ramp with monitoring.
• Remove temporary exceptions; re-enable services only after IC “go-live” gate.
• Monitor closely for **2× business days** minimum (longer for Sev-1).

4.7 POST-INCIDENT REVIEW (PIR)
Within **5 business days** (Sev-1/2) or **10** (Sev-3):
• Timeline; root cause (5-whys); impact; data involved; control failures; what worked/what didn’t.
• Action items with owners & due dates (90/60/30 day targets by severity).
• Share sanitized lessons in `#security-announcements`.
• Update playbooks, controls, training, and exception logs.

5. COMMUNICATIONS

5.1 INTERNAL
• IC posts hourly updates during Sev-1/2 (or faster if changing).
• Use incident channel & ticket only; **no email to broad lists** unless Comms Lead approves.

5.2 EXTERNAL (customers/partners/regulators/media)
• **Only Comms Lead & Legal/Privacy** may speak externally.
• Rules: factual, minimal, non-speculative; share what happened, what it affects, what we’re doing, and what customers should do.
• Keep a **Disclosure Log** (who, when, summary, commitments).
• If required by contract (DPA/NDA), notify counterparties per timelines.

5.3 DRAFT TEMPLATES (snippets)

**Initial holding line (public/clients):**
“Earlier today we detected a security incident affecting \[service scope]. We contained the issue and are investigating with elevated monitoring. If we identify data impacts requiring customer action, we will contact affected customers directly. Updates will follow.”

**Regulatory style (privacy):**
“On \[date/time], AliceSolutions became aware of unauthorized \[access/disclosure] involving \[category of personal information]. We contained the incident on \[time], initiated forensics, and are notifying affected individuals/organizations as appropriate. Contact: privacy@….”

6. LEGAL & PRIVACY WORKFLOWS
   • Determine whether PI/PHI involved; if yes, DPO leads breach law analysis.
   • For Canadian PI: assess **risk of significant harm**, notification/reporting, and breach record entry.
   • For PHI (Ontario): notify affected individuals at the **first reasonable opportunity** and determine if IPC reporting thresholds are met.
   • For EU/UK data: coordinate GDPR/UK GDPR timelines (e.g., 72h supervisory authority clock) where applicable.
   • Preserve all evidence & comms under **legal hold** for Major Incidents.

7. SEVERITY-BASED SLAS (summary)
   \| Severity | Detect→IC | Contain | Initial Exec Brief | Customer Notice\* | PIR Due |
   \|---------|-----------|--------|--------------------|------------------|--------|
   \| Sev-1   | ≤5 min    | ≤1 h  | ≤30 min            | As advised by Legal (often <72h GDPR / prompt under PIPEDA/PHIPA) | 5 bd |
   \| Sev-2   | ≤15 min   | ≤4 h  | ≤2 h               | As advised by Legal | 5 bd |
   \| Sev-3   | Same day  | ≤2 bd | If needed          | If needed         | 10 bd |
   \| Sev-4   | 2 bd      | As needed | N/A             | N/A              | Optional |

\*Customer/regulator notice depends on law/contract and risk assessment.

   • Record **chain of custody** (who collected, when, from where, checksum).
   • Never modify original media; analyze copies.
   • For cloud: capture config snapshots (IdP, CI/CD, Render.com, storage ACLs).
   **Minimum fields (Incident Ticket):** IR-ID, title, reporter, time detected, severity, systems, data tier(s), suspected data categories, actions taken, evidence references, legal assessment, external comms log, resolution time, PIR link.

10. TOOLS & INTEGRATIONS
    • Paging: on-call schedule (Teams/Calendars).
    • Bridge: auto channel `#ir-<date>-<name>` with conference link.
    • Ticketing: `IR-####` in Hub; link to repos/CI/CD/Render resources.
    • SIEM/Logs: per Logging Standard; queries versioned.
    • EDR/MDM: Intune + Defender actions scripted (isolate, collect, release).
    • Secrets: rotation scripts tied to tiers and Exception Log.

11. METRICS & REPORTING (quarterly review)
    • MTTA/MTTR by severity; % incidents meeting SLAs.
    • % access reviews completed on time during/after incidents.
    • # of DLP events per 1k actions; repeated offenders.
    • Restore success rate & time during drills.
    • Open/overdue PIR action items.

12. TRAINING & TESTING
    • All-hands annual security training; IR drills **twice per year** (include one after hours).
    • New ICs & Leads shadow at least one drill.
    • After each drill: PIR-Lite and control updates.

13. ESCALATION & DECISION MATRIX (quick)
    • Take service down? — IC + Project Owner + Org.Owner
    • Disclose publicly? — Legal/Privacy + Comms Lead + Org.Owner
    • Pay ransom? — **No** by default; any discussion requires Legal/Privacy, Org.Owner, and law enforcement advice.
    • Law enforcement contact? — Legal/Privacy decision; IC executes.

14. RECORDS & RETENTION
    • Incident records, evidence, and comms retained **≥ 2 years** (≥ 7 years if legal hold) unless stricter law/contract requires longer.
    • Privacy breach records retained per DPA/law.
    • Storage location: `/server/IR/IR-####/` with subfolders: `/evidence`, `/reports`, `/comms`, `/screenshots`.

15. VERSIONING & APPROVAL
    • Changes via PR; CISO approval required.
    • Next review: **12 months** from effective date or post-Major Incident.
