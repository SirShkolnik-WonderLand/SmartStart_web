      question: "What's included in the SmartStart membership?",
      answer: "Your $98.80/month membership includes: Zoho enterprise suite (CRM, Projects, Books, Mail, Cliq), Acronis security & backup, mentorship from Udi Shkolnik and peers, frameworks for funding and ISO compliance, and secure data handling (GDPR + PIPEDA aligned)."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is SmartStart for?",
      answer: "Freelancers, small business owners, startups, and entrepreneurs who want enterprise tools, mentorship, and security without the enterprise price. If you're building or scaling a business and need automation, compliance, and guidance, SmartStart is for you."
    },
    {
      question: "How is WonderLand different from SmartStart?",
      answer: "WonderLand is our community where you can attend events, network, and explore ideas. SmartStart ($98.80/month) gives you access to enterprise tools, mentorship, and security. WonderLand is the playground where ideas are born. SmartStart is the lab where those ideas become real."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the billing and cancellation policy?",
      answer: "SmartStart is $98.80 CAD/month + tax. You can cancel anytime with no long-term commitment. Billing is handled through Zoho Subscriptions. You'll be charged monthly on the same date you first subscribed."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to commit long-term?",
      answer: "No. SmartStart is month-to-month with no long-term commitment. You can cancel anytime."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I try SmartStart before committing?",
      answer: "Yes. You can join WonderLand first to explore events, network, and see if our ecosystem is a good fit. When you're ready for enterprise tools and mentorship, you can upgrade to SmartStart."
    },
    {
      question: "What tools do I get access to?",
      answer: "The full Zoho suite (CRM, Projects, Books, Mail, Cliq, Vault), Acronis Cyber Backup for security and data protection, and the SmartStart Hub platform. These tools would cost $500+/month if purchased individually."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data secure?",
      answer: "Yes. We use enterprise-grade security with Acronis backup, GDPR + PIPEDA aligned data handling, and security-first baselines. Your data is private and secure. We implement guardrails and documented procedures."
