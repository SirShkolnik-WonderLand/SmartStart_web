## 🏗️ What is SmartStart Platform?

SmartStart Platform is a **Venture Operating System** that provides everything a new venture needs in one controlled ecosystem:

- **Infrastructure**: IT pack provisioning (M365, GitHub, hosting, backups)
- **Governance**: Legal contracts, equity management, compliance
- **Community**: Contributor management, skill verification, reputation system
- **Security**: KYC/KYB, device posture, audit logging

## 🎮 Core Features

### Venture Management
- Create and manage ventures with equity tracking
- Automated contract generation and signing
- IT pack provisioning and management

### User Profiles & Reputation
- KYC-verified user identities
- Skill verification and badges
- Portfolio tracking and trust scores

### Equity & Token System
- Dynamic equity ledger with vesting policies
- BUZ token economy for contributions
- Quarterly rebalancing and performance tracking

### Security & Compliance
- Multi-factor authentication
- Device posture compliance
- Immutable audit logging
- Legal hold management

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **Deployment**: Render.com (free tier optimized)
- **Storage**: AWS S3 integration
- **Email**: SMTP integration with queue processing

## 📊 Free Tier Optimization

The platform has been specifically optimized for Render.com's free tier:

- ✅ **3 services maximum** (database + API + frontend)
- ✅ **Consolidated backend** (all functionality in one service)
- ✅ **Efficient builds** (40-60% faster deployment)
- ✅ **Smart resource management** (stays within limits)
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** (features work with or without external services)

## 🔧 Getting Help
