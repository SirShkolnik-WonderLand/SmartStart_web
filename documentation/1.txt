Got it. Here’s a **clean, system-level journey** you can wire to your existing APIs without writing any new code today. It’s non-linear (users can loop/branch), but every stage has **goals, gates, data I/O, policy hooks, and provisioning logic** so your CLI UI can render it as a guided flow.

# SmartStart Hub — **VentureGate™ Journey**

## Purpose (one sentence)

Turn strangers into trusted contributors: **subscribe → sign platform legal pack → discover ventures/projects → offer to contribute → sign per-project NDA/addenda → get provisioned → work, track, and earn — with duties that survive exit.**

---

## Core Principles

* **Trust-by-Design:** Legal + security gates unlock **just-enough access** at each step.
* **Data-Minimizing Views:** Until NDA, show **safe previews** only (no source code, no secrets).
* **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** All actions produce **audited events** and **immutable records**.
* **RBAC Everywhere:** Roles drive what the user can see/create at each point (Founder, Project Lead, Contributor, Reviewer, Legal).
* **Contract-before-Content:** No sensitive assets without a signed platform pack + per-project NDA/addenda.
* **Surviving Duties:** Confidentiality and non-exfil obligations **survive exit** (5 years).

---

## System Actors & Permissions (high level)

* **Guest** – browse public info, no data access
* **Member** – paid subscriber; can pitch/offer to contribute
* **Founder** (plan-gated) – can create ventures/projects
* **Project Lead** – approves offers, issues per-project NDA/addenda
* **Legal/Compliance** – maintains templates, flags conflicts, enforces survival clauses
* **Admin** – policy + provisioning overrides

---

## Canonical Objects (records you persist)

* **User** (identity, plan, MFA status)
* **Subscription** (tier, status, invoices)
* **Platform Legal Pack** (signed: Platform Participation Agreement + Platform NDA)
* **Venture** (owner, governance)
* **Project** (classification, data sensitivity profile)
* **Offer** (a structured “I want to contribute” pitch)
* **Per-Project NDA** (and **Addenda**) – signed instance with scope + term
* **Provisioning Grant** (RBAC scopes, resources, expiries)
* **Contribution** (work units, artifacts, XP, BUZ, equity events)
* **Offboarding Record** (revocations, attestations, surviving duties)

# The Journey Graph (non-linear, with gates)

Below, each node lists **Goal • Entry Conditions • Actions • Outputs • Security/Policy Gates**. Your CLI can show it as a checklist, but the system allows lateral movement.

### 0) **Discover**

* **Goal:** Let potential users see the value safely.
* **Entry:** Anonymous user.
* **Actions:** View public ventures/projects, read “How it works”, see sample rewards/XP/badges.
* **Outputs:** None (tracking: interest → funnel).
* **Gates:** No secrets. All assets watermarked previews only.

---

### 1) **Create Account**

* **Goal:** Establish identity & terms for processing.
* **Entry:** From Discover.
* **Actions:** Email/Pass or SSO; accept ToS/Privacy (not NDA yet).
* **Outputs:** `User` record (unverified).
* **Gates:** Rate-limit, bot checks.

---

### 2) **Verify & Secure**

* **Goal:** Trust the session.
* **Entry:** User exists.
* **Actions:** Email verify; enforce MFA; optional device posture check; optional KYC if you ever need payouts.
* **Outputs:** Verified `User` with `mfa=true`.
* **Gates:** Block progress without MFA (security baseline).

---

### 3) **Choose Plan & Pay**

* **Goal:** Monetize and gate capabilities.
* **Entry:** Verified user.
* **Actions:** Pick tier (Member / Pro / Founder); pay; issue invoice.
* **Outputs:** `Subscription` (active), plan entitlements (e.g., **Founder** can create ventures/projects; **Member** can submit offers).
* **Gates:** Failed/expired payments auto-downgrade capabilities.

---

### 4) **Platform Legal Pack (mandatory, one-time)**

* **Goal:** Contract before content.
* **Entry:** Active subscription.
* **Actions:** E-sign **Platform Participation Agreement (PPA)** containing:

  * **Platform NDA** (global confidentiality)
  * **5-Year Confidentiality & Non-Exfiltration** (no carrying data outside AliceSolutions Ventures ecosystem for 5 years after last access)
  * **Inventions & IP** (background vs foreground IP; assignment/licensing rules)
  * **Non-Circumvention & Non-Solicitation** (limited scope)
  * **Open-Source Compliance** (declare third-party licenses)
  * **Audit & Logging Consent** (security monitoring)
  * **Jurisdiction & Survival** (e.g., Ontario; clauses survive termination)
* **Outputs:** Signed `Platform Legal Pack` (hash, timestamp, signatory evidence).
* **Gates:** No venture/project detail beyond safe previews until signed.

> *Note:* The above is business logic; get counsel to finalize language.

---

### 5) **Profile & Fit**

* **Goal:** Matchmaking signal.
* **Entry:** Legal pack signed.
* **Actions:** Set skills, availability, interests, preferred venture stage; connect portfolio/Git; select NDA language preference; accept **Content Safety Policy** (no recording, no scraping).
* **Outputs:** Enhanced `User` profile (match vectors).
* **Gates:** None; improves recommendations & auto-routing.

---

### 6) **Explore Ventures/Projects (Safe Mode)**

* **Goal:** Let users explore **without leakage**.
* **Entry:** Profile complete.
* **Actions:** Browse ventures/projects; view **redacted briefs** (objectives, stack, role needs, rewards); for Founder plan: create new venture/project.
* **Outputs:** `Project` (if founder creates), or shortlist for the user.
* **Gates:** **No raw repos, no secrets**; assets shown via read-only, watermarked previewers; copy/export disabled; access logged.

---

### 7) **Offer to Contribute (Pitch)**

* **Goal:** Structured, comparable offers.
* **Entry:** From any project page.
* **Actions:** Submit **Offer** with: role, scope, deliverables, time window, rate/equity preference, conflicts of interest disclosure, and “I’m ok to sign project NDA if selected”.
* **Outputs:** `Offer` record; status = *Submitted*.
* **Gates:** Rate-limit; auto conflict checks (e.g., similar projects in last 6 months).

---

### 8) **Per-Project NDA & Addenda (just-in-time)**

* **Goal:** Narrow confidentiality to what the project actually needs.
* **Entry:** Offer shortlisted by Project Lead.
* **Actions:** System issues **Per-Project NDA** instance + **Addenda** tailored to classification:

  * **Scope & Term** (e.g., 5-year post-access confidentiality; project-specific)
  * **Data Classification** (what’s “Confidential” vs “Restricted”)
  * **Permitted Use** (solely for project deliverables)
  * **Non-Exfiltration Controls** (no external storage; no LLM uploads unless explicitly allowed; no screenshots)
  * **Tooling Zones** (allowed repos, ticketing, storage)
  * **Deliverables Licensing & IP Outcome** (assignment or dual-license)
  * **Export/Trade Controls** (if applicable)
* **Outputs:** Signed `Per-Project NDA` (instance) + optional **Addenda** (hashes stored).
* **Gates:** Signature is a hard gate before any provisioning.

---

### 9) **Approval & Provisioning**

* **Goal:** Minimal, revocable access.
* **Entry:** Project NDA signed.
* **Actions:** Project Lead (and optionally Legal) **approve** the Offer; system creates **Provisioning Grant**:

  * RBAC roles (Reader/Contributor/Maintainer)
  * Least-privilege resource scopes (repo paths, docs, envs)
  * **Expiry** (default 30–90 days, auto-review)
  * **DLP Guardrails** (watermarking, restricted download, content scanning)
  * **2FA enforcement** (deny if disabled)
* **Outputs:** Active `Provisioning Grant` + notification with **Getting Started** checklist.
* **Gates:** All access logged; secrets masked by default; elevated access requires second reviewer.

---

### 10) **Work, Track, Reward**

* **Goal:** Make contribution measurable and fair.
* **Entry:** Provisioned.
* **Actions:**

  * Deliver tasks; attach artifacts to **Contribution** records
  * Auto-log PRs, tickets, commits; map to XP/Badges and **BUZ** token grants
  * Optional equity events (for founder-grade contributors) via **Equity Grant** policy
  * Weekly retro: acceptance vs revisions; velocity & quality score
* **Outputs:** `Contribution` entries; **Rewards** (XP, badges, BUZ), possible equity vesting events.
* **Gates:** DLP monitors; policy on LLM usage; flagged events trigger human review.

---

### 11) **Account & Billing Lifecycles (background)**

* **Goal:** Keep access consistent with money & risk.
* **Entry:** Ongoing.
* **Actions:** Renewals, failed payments → grace periods and **capability downgrades** (no new offers, cannot create projects); existing NDA obligations **still enforced**.
* **Outputs:** Updated `Subscription` + access entitlements.
* **Gates:** Automatic revocation on persistent non-payment.

---

### 12) **Exit & Offboarding (Duties Persist)**

* **Goal:** Clean breakup, strong survivals.
* **Entry:** User-initiated or project-ended.
* **Actions:** Revoke all grants; collect **Return/Delete Attestation**; watermark last views; require **Surviving Duties Acknowledgment** (5-year confidentiality & non-exfil remains; no solicitation/circumvention for the defined period); archive audit trail.
* **Outputs:** `Offboarding Record` + signed attestation.
* **Gates:** Any post-exit access attempts trigger alerts.

---

## Policy Pack (what must exist in templates)

**Platform Participation Agreement (signed once):**

* Global NDA + 5-year confidentiality/non-exfil **from last access**
* Clear IP treatment (background vs foreground; assignment or license)
* Non-circumvention, limited non-solicit
* Use-of-tools policy (no external LLM uploads unless whitelisted)
* Monitoring/audit consent; data retention; governing law; survival

**Per-Project NDA (+ Addenda, issued per project):**

* Narrow scope, project-specific term (usually 5 years)
* Data classifications & permitted use
* Tooling zones and DLP requirements
* Deliverables license/IP outcome
* Optional export-control clauses

*(Business logic, not legal advice—have counsel finalize.)*

---

## Security Controls by Stage (short list)

* **MFA mandatory** post-signup; deny provisioning if off
* **Watermarked previewers** pre-NDA
* **DLP** on downloads/attachments; block copy/paste where feasible
* **Just-in-time NDAs**; revocable **time-boxed** grants
* **Full audit trail** (who saw what, when)
* **Device checks** (optional: block jailbroken/rooted, enforce OS patch level for sensitive projects)

---

## CLI Journey Commands (no code, only taxonomy your UI can expose)

* `account:create`, `account:verify`, `auth:mfa:enable`
* `plan:list`, `plan:subscribe`, `billing:invoice:list`
* `legal:platform:read`, `legal:platform:sign`
* `profile:setup`, `profile:update`
* `ventures:list`, `projects:list`, `project:create` (Founder)
* `offer:create --project <id>`, `offer:status`
* `nda:issue --project <id> --offer <id>` (Lead), `nda:sign`
* `offer:approve`, `provision:grant:list`
* `work:log`, `contrib:list`, `reward:claim`
* `account:downgrade`, `exit:initiate`, `offboard:attest`

---

## Funnel & Ops Metrics (what to track)

* Discover → Signup conversion
* Signup → Plan conversion, time-to-pay
* Plan → Platform Pack sign rate & time-to-sign
* Offers per active member; shortlist rate; NDA acceptance rate
* Offer → Approval SLA; time-to-provision
* First-week contribution rate; acceptance ratio
* DLP flags per 1,000 events; revocations; breach attempts
* Exit compliance (attestation completion time)

---

## Edge Cases & Decisions

* **Payment failed:** freeze new offers & project creation; do not yank current project access mid-sprint without grace unless risk flagged.
* **NDA refused:** keep user as Member; show only safe previews; allow offers to other projects.
* **Conflict of interest:** auto-flag; require Legal override.
* **Multiple offers to same project:** allow but dedupe; keep most recent active.
* **Plan downgrade:** retain signed duties; disable creation capabilities; keep read-only access per project policy or revoke at next checkpoint.

---

## What this unlocks for your frontend (today)

* A **single “Journey” screen** that shows current stage, unmet gates, and next eligible actions.
* Contextual actions (e.g., **“You’re paid and verified; sign the Platform Pack to unlock project details.”**)
* Safe exploration with **preview-only** assets until NDA.
* Crisp approvals with **one-click NDA → provision** pipeline.
* Always-on **duties panel** reminding users of surviving obligations.

If you want, I can turn each node above into a **1-page acceptance spec** (inputs, validations, API calls, success/failure messages) so your CLI can implement it command-by-command while staying perfectly aligned with your 150+ endpoints.
