# Complete Booking System - Fixed & Organized âœ…

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** All Issues Resolved

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Fixed

### **Problem 1: contact.html Was Broken**
**BEFORE:** Redirected to smartstart.html
```javascript
window.location.replace('smartstart.html');
```

**AFTER:** Full-featured contact form with service type selection
- Real contact form for general inquiries
- Service type dropdown (Advisory, Automation, Cybersecurity, Assessment, General)
- Proper fields: name, email, phone, company, location, timeline, budget, message
- Auto-redirects to booking.html if user selects "Training"
- Same beautiful design style as all other pages

### **Problem 2: booking.html Mismatch**
**BEFORE:** Advisory/Automation/Cybersecurity pages linked to booking.html, but it only showed training services

**AFTER:** Clear separation of purposes:
- **booking.html** = Training workshops ONLY (with multi-step booking flow)
- **contact.html** = Advisory, Automation, Cybersecurity, Assessments, General inquiries

### **Problem 3: Confusing CTAs**
**BEFORE:** All service pages used booking.html for everything

**AFTER:** Service-specific routing:
- **Advisory pages** â†’ `contact.html?type=advisory`
- **Automation pages** â†’ `contact.html?type=automation`
- **Cybersecurity pages** â†’ `contact.html?type=cybersecurity` or `?type=assessment`
- **Training pages** â†’ `booking.html?service=cissp` (etc.)
